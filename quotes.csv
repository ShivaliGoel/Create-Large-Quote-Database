"The world is all gates, all opportunities, strings of tension waiting to be struck."
"I confess that altruistic and cynically selfish talk seem to me about equally unreal. With all humility, I think 'whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might,' infinitely more important than the vain attempt to love one's neighbour as one's self. If you want to hit a bird on the wing you must have all your will in focus, you must not be thinking about yourself, and equally, you must not be thinking about your neighbour; you must be living with your eye on that bird.

"Never deny a diagnosis, but do deny the negative verdict that may go with it."
"All that is necessary is to accept the impossible, do without the indispensable, and bear the intolerable."
The happy and efficient people in this world are those who accept trouble as a normal detail of human life and resolve to capitalize it when it comes along.
"For those who live neither with religious consolations about death nor with a sense of death (or of anything else) as natural, death is the obscene mystery, the ultimate affront, the thing that cannot be controlled. It can only be denied."
Who except the gods can live without any pain?
Misfortune comes to all men.

"Against necessity, against its strength, no one can fight and win."
A wise man never refuses anything to necessity.

The individual who is best prepared for any occupation is the one ... able to adapt himself to any situation.
"To act with common sense, according to the moment, is the best wisdom; and the best philosophy is to do one's duties, to take the world as it comes, submit respectfully to one's lot, and bless the goodness that has given us so much happiness with it, whatever it is."
The art of life lies in a constant readjustment to our surroundings.
To repel one's cross is to make it heavier.

One learns to adapt to the land in which one lives.

"In the face of an obstacle which is impossible to overcome, stubbornness is stupid."

You'll never find a better sparring partner than adversity.
The English nation is never so great as in adversity.
Enemies can be an incentive to survive and become someone in spite of them. Enemies can keep you alert and aware.
Problems are the cutting edge that distinguishes between success and failure. Problems ... create our courage and wisdom.
It is often better to have a great deal of harm happen to one than a little; a great deal may rouse you to remove what a little will only accustom you to endure.

"Discontent and disorder were signs of energy and hope, not of despair."
We say: mad with joy. We should say: wise with grief.

Times of stress and difficulty are seasons of opportunity when the seeds of progress are sown.
"The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor man perfected without trials."
"As there is no worldly gain without some loss, so there is no worldly loss without some gain.... Set the allowance against the loss, and thou shalt find no loss great."
Never complain about your troubles; they are responsible for more than half of your income.
A problem is a chance for you to do your best.
Emergencies have always been necessary to progress. It was darkness which produced the lamp. It was fog that produced the compass. It was hunger that drove us to exploration. And it took a depression to teach us the real value of a job.

"In my youth, poverty enriched me, but now I can afford wealth."
I'm very grateful that I was too poor to get to art school until I was 21. ... I was old enough when I got there to know how to get something out of it.
"The most valuable gift I ever received was ... the gift of insecurity ... my father left us. My mother's love might not have prepared me for life the way my father's departure did. He forced us out on the road, where we had to earn our bread."

"The incessant witless repetition of advertisers' moron-fodder has become so much a part of life that if we are not careful, we forget to be insulted by it."
There is no such thing as bad publicity except your own obituary.
The advertisements in a newspaper are more full of knowledge in respect to what is going on in a state or community than the editorial columns are.
"If it doesn't sell, it isn't creative."
In advertising not to be different is virtually suicidal.
Advertising - a judicious mixture of flattery and threats.

The advice of the elders to young men is very apt to be as unreal as a list of the hundred best books.

The only thing to do with good advice is to pass it on. It is never of any use to oneself.
A good scare is worth more to a man than good advice.
There is little serenity comparable to the serenity of the inexperienced giving advice to the experienced.
Advice is seldom welcome; and those who want it the most always like it the least.

"I am 65 and I guess that puts me in with the geriatrics. But if there were 15 months in every year, I'd only be 48. That's the trouble with us. We number everything. Take women, for example, I think they deserve to have more than 12 years between the ages of 28 and 40."

"There is a difference between a psychopath and a neurotic. A psychopath thinks two and two are five. A neurotic knows that two and two are four, but he worries about it."
Worrying helps you some. It seems as if you are doing something when you're worrying.
"Everything great in the world comes from neurotics. They alone have founded our religions, and composed our masterpieces. Never will the world know all it owes to them, nor all they have suffered to enrich us."
For what human ill does not dawn seem to be an alleviation.
No sensible person ever made an apology.
Apology is only egotism wrong side out.

He who praises another enriches himself far more than he does the one praised. To praise is an investment in happiness. The poorest human being has something to give that the richest could not buy.
The way to develop the best that is in a man is by appreciation and encouragement.
The applause of a single human being is of great consequence.
"Most people like praise . . . When it is really deserved, most people expand under it into richer and better selves."
The sweetest of all sounds is praise.
"Down deep we really know our worth, but we don't have easy access to that knowledge. We need to hear praise coming from outside ourselves or we won't remember that we deserve it."
Find the good - and praise it.
"Every day, tell at least one person something you like, admire, or appreciate about them."
Judicious praise is to children what the sun is to flowers. Christian Bovee A little praise Goes a great ways.
"Art is much less important than life, but what a poor life without it."
Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.
"Without art, the crudeness of reality would make the world unbearable."
"Art is a staple, like bread or wine or a warm coat in winter. Man's spirit grows hungry for art in the same way his stomach growls for food."
The object of art is to give life a shape.
The artist has a special task and duty; the task of reminding men of their humanity and the promise of their creativity.
"Each of us is an artist, capable of conceiving and creating a vision from the depths of our being."
All that is good in art is the expression of one soul talking to another; and is precious according to the greatness of the soul that utters it.
"The artist alone sees spirits. But after he has told of their appearing to him, everybody sees them."
"Artists are nearest God. Into their souls he breathes his life, and from their hands it comes in fair, articulate forms to bless the world."
"A work of art has an author and yet, when it is perfect, it has something which is anonymous about it."
The true work of art is but a shadow of the divine perfection.
"The artist is the confidant of nature, flowers carry on dialogues with him through the graceful bending of their stems and the harmoniously tinted nuances of their blossoms. Every flower has a cordial word which nature directs towards him."
"There are painters who transform the sun to a yellow spot, but there are others who with the help of their art and their intelligence, transform a yellow spot into sun."
Science and art have that in common that everyday things seem to them new and attractive.
Art arises when the secret vision of the artist and the manifestation of nature agree to find new shapes.
Learning to draw is really a matter of learning to see - to see correctly - and that means a good deal more than merely looking with the eye.
"Drawing is the discipline by which I constantly rediscover the world. I have learned that what I have not drawn, I have never really seen, and that when I start drawing an ordinary thing, I realize how extraordinary it is, sheer miracle."
I shut my eyes in order to see.
"Dancing is the loftiest, the most moving, the most beautiful of the arts, because it is no mere translation or abstraction from life; it is life itself."
The body says what words cannot.
Dancing is the body made poetic.
The trouble with nude dancing is that not everything stops when the music stops.
Let that day be lost to us on which we did not dance once I
"If you can walk, you can dance. Zimbabwe saying Music is well said to be the speech of angels."
"Music is the child of prayer, the companion of religion."
"Music is the art of the prophets, the only art that can calm the agitations of the soul; it is one of the most magnificent and delightful presents God has given us."
"Musical training is a more potent instrument than any other, because rhythm and harmony find their way into the inward places of the soul."
"We are full of rhythms . . . our pulse, our gestures, our digestive tracts, the lunar and seasonal cycles."
"When I hear music, I fear no danger. I am invulnerable. I see no foe. I am related to the earliest times, and to the latest."
"The best, most beautiful, and most perfect way that we have of expressing a sweet concord of mind to each other is by music."
"When words leave off, music begins."
After silence that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music.
Music is the universal language of mankind.
"There is no feeling, except the extremes of fear and grief that does not find relief in music."
"Without music, life is a journey through a desert."
I merely took the energy it takes to pout and wrote some blues.
"God respects me when I work, but loves me when I sing."
"We all have music inside us, and can learn how to get it out, one way or another."
"Poetry ennobles the heart and the eyes, and unveils the meaning of all things upon which the heart and the eyes dwell. It discovers the secret rays of the universe, and restores to us forgotten paradises."
To read a poem in January is as lovely as to go for a walk in June.
"Poetry is something to make us wiser and better, by continually revealing those types of beauty and truth, which God has set in all men's souls."
"The poem is a little myth of man's capacity of making his life meaningful. And in the end, the poem is not a thing we see - it is, rather, a light by which we may see - and what we see is life."
Poetry is the utterance of deep and heartfelt truth. The true poet is very near the oracle.
The poets are only the interpreters of the gods.
"Poetry is simply the most beautiful, impressive, and widely effective mode of saying things."
"When power narrows the area of man's concern, poetry reminds him of the richness and diversity of his existence."
"When you read and understand a poem, comprehending its rich and formal meanings, then you master chaos a little."
There is as much dignity in tilling a field as in writing a poem.
You will find poetry nowhere unless you bring some of it with you.
The echo of a platitude.
"Applause is the spur of noble minds, the end and aim of weak ones."
About the only person we ever heard of that wasn't spoiled by being lionized was a Jew named Daniel.
Architecture is a continuing dialogue between generations which creates an environment across time.
"Why can't we have those curves and arches that express feeling in design? What is wrong with them? Why has everything got to be vertical, straight, unbending, only at right angles - and functional?"
You have to give this much to the Luftwaffe - when it knocked down our buildings it did not replace them with anything more offensive than rubble. We did that.
To be an architect is to possess an individual voice speaking a generally understood language of form.
"In architecture the pride of man, his triumph over gravitation, his will to power, assume a visible form. Architecture is a sort of oratory of power by means of forms."
"The materials of city planning are sky, space, trees, steel and cement in that order and in that hierarchy."
Buildings should be good neighbours.
Pictures deface walls oftener than they decorate them.
"Life is rich, always changing, always challenging, and we architects have the task of transmitting into wood, concrete, glass and steel, of transforming human aspirations into habitable and meaningful space."

Perspective is worth 80 I.Q. points.
Architecture is the will of an epoch translated into space.
"When you look on one of your contemporary 'good copies' of historical remains, ask yourself the question: Not what style, but in what civilization is this building? And the absurdity, vulgarity, anachronism and solecism of the modern structure will be revealed to you in a most startling fashion."
"Light, God's eldest daughter, is a principal beauty in a building."
No architecture can be truly noble which is not imperfect.
Architecture is inhabited sculpture.
The flowering of geometry.
Society needs a good image of itself. That is the job of the architect.
Architecture begins when you place two bricks carefully together.
An arch never sleeps.
Develop an infallible technique and then place yourself at the mercy of inspiration.
"The reality of the building does not consist in the roof and walls, but in the space within to be lived in."
Good architecture lets nature in.
Architecture should be dedicated to keeping the outside out and the inside in.
Early in life I had to choose between arrogance and hypocritical humility. I chose honest arrogance and have seen no occasion to change.
"No house should ever be on a hill, or on anything. It should be of the hill. Hill and house should live together, each the happier for the other."
How can we expect our students to become bold and fearless in thought and action if we encase them in sentimental shrines feigning a culture which has long since disappeared?
The house does not frame the view: it projects the beholder into it.
Architecture is space structured to serve man and to move him.
"Take nothing for granted as beautiful or ugly, but take every building to pieces, and challenge every feature. Learn to distinguish the curious from the beautiful. Get the habit of analysis - analysis will in time enable synthesis to become your habit of mind. 'Think simples' as my old master used to say - meaning to reduce the whole of its parts into the simplest terms, getting back to first principles."
"Always design a thing by considering it in its next larger context - a chair in a room, a room in a house, a house in an environment, an environment in a city plan."
"In speculative buildings, which is most of our business, there are really only three chances to make architecture: the lobby or entrance sequence, the top and the elevator cab."
A house is a machine for living.
"A doctor can bury his mistakes, but an architect can only advise his clients to plant vines."

"Genius is personal, decided by fate, but it expresses itself by means of system. There is no work of art without system."
We shape our buildings; thereafter they shape us.
I call architecture 'petrified music'.
Form ever follows function.
"Old houses mended, Cost little less than new before they're ended."
Architecture is frozen music.
"Ah, to build, to build! That is the noblest of all the arts."
Arguments out of a petty mouth are unanswerable.
Many can argue; not many converse.
"Wise men argue causes, and fools decide them."
"When Bishop Berkeley said, ""there was no matter,"" And proved it - 'twas no matter what he said."
Neither irony nor sarcasm is argument.
"I am bound to furnish my antagonists with arguments, but not with comprehension."
Strong and bitter words indicate a weak cause.
Insolence is not logic; epithets are the arguments of malice.
"Myself when young did eagerly frequent Doctor and Saint, and heard great argument About it and about: but evermore Came out by the same door where in I went."
"Never argue at the dinner table, for the one who is not hungry always gets the best of the argument."
When people agree with me I always feel that I must be wrong.
A man never tells you anything until you contradict him.
"In a true tragedy, both parties must be right."
"Some guy hit my fender the other day, and I said unto him, ""Be fruitful, and multiply."" But not in those words."
"We're eyeball to eyeball, and the other fellow just blinked."
"Weakness on both sides is, as we know, the motto of all quarrels."
There is no good arguing with the inevitable. The only argument available with an east wind is to put on your overcoat.
It is not necessary to understand things in order to argue about them.
"I learned long ago never to wrestle with a pig. You get dirty, and besides, the pig likes it."

"Every story has three sides to it - yours, mine and the facts."
"(Ars longa, vita brevis.) Art is long, life is short. A picture can become for us a highway between a particular thing and a universal feeling."
A work of art cannot be satisfied with being a representation; it should be a presentation.
An amateur is an artist who supports himself with outside jobs which enable him to paint. A professional is someone whose wife works to enable him to paint.
Art distills sensation and embodies it with enhanced meaning in memorable form - or else it is not art.
Artistic temperament is a disease that afflicts amateurs.
"Artists are the antennae of the race, but the bullet-headed many will never learn to trust the great artists."
"Artists must be sacrificed to their art. Like bees, they must put their lives into the sting they give."
"Artists, by definition innocent, don't steal. But they do borrow without giving back."
As a painter I shall never signify anything of importance. I feel it absolutely.
"Classic means standard as opposed to Romantic: form before meaning as opposed to meaning before form. It grows from inside out, while Romantic grows from outside in."

"Good artists exist simply in what they make, and consequently are perfectly uninteresting in what they are."

"I wonder whether Art has a higher function than to make me feel, appreciate, and enjoy natural objects for their art value?"
I've been 40 years discovering that the Queen of all colours is black.

The artist. . . faithful to his personal vision of reality, becomes the last champion of the individual mind and sensibility against an intrusive society and an offensive state."
Art is the expression of an enormous preference.

A picture lives by companionship. It dies by the same token. It is therefore risky to send it out into the world. How often it must be impaired by the eyes of the unfeeling.
"Abstract art is uniquely modern. It is a fundamentally romantic response to modern life - rebellious, individualistic, unconventional, sensitive, irritable."
"Culture is something you cannot buy, something you cannot import, something you cannot learn or produce at will. A writer, an artist or musician cannot sit down and say 'Now I will produce culture.' Culture is something that evolves out of the simple, enduring elements of everyday life; elements most truthfully expressed in the folk arts and crafts of a nation."

"What's an artist, but the dregs of his work - the human shambles that follows it around?"
"Art has no other object than to set aside the symbols of practical utility, the generalities that are conventionally and socially accepted, everything in fact which masks reality from us, in order to set us face to face with reality itself."

It is not in life but in art that self-fulfillment is to be found.
"An artist never really finishes his work, he merely abandons it."
"I am convinced it is a mistake to find an artist human outside his work. If you cannot find him human in and through his work, you are better not to know it when you come to formulate an opinion of his public value."
"One must work, nothing but work, and one must have patience."
Art does not reproduce the visible; rather it makes it visible.
"The more horrifying this world becomes, the more art becomes abstract."

Art is based on order. The world is full of 'sloppy Bohemians' and their work betrays them.

Juvenile appraisals of other juveniles make up in clarity what they lack in charity.

"God made the country, and man made the town."
"Cities force growth, and make men talkative and entertaining, but they make them artificial."
In the busy haunts of men.

Yet every man, every civilization, has gone forward because of its engagement with what it has set itself to do. The personal commitment and the emotional commitment working together as one, has made the Ascent of Man."
Civilization is just a slow process of learning to be kind.
Civilization is a movement - not a condition; a voyage - not a harbour.
Since barbarism has its pleasures it naturally has its apologists.
"We sit by and watch the barbarian. We tolerate him in the long stretches of peace, we are not afraid. We are tickled by his irreverence; his comic inversion of our old certitudes and our fixed creed refreshes us; we laugh. But as we laugh we are watched by large and awful faces from beyond, and on these faces there are no smiles."
"A race preserves its vigour so long as it harbours a real contrast between what has been and what may be, and so long as it is nerved by the vigour to adventure beyond the safeties of the past. Without adventure, civilization is in full decay."
"Civilizations die from philosophical calm, irony, and the sense of fair play quite as surely as they die of debauchery."
"The three great elements of modern civilization, Gunpowder, Printing, and the Protestant Religion."
A savage is simply a human organism that has not received enough news from the human race.
This is the way the world ends Not with a bang but a whimper.
A tablecloth restaurant is still one of the great rewards of civilization.
The end of the human race will be that it will eventually die of civilization.
"If you would civilize a man, begin with his grandmother."
To be a man is to feel that one's own stone contributes to building the edifice of the world.

Politics and the pulpit are terms that have little agreement.
"As a career, the business of an orthodox preacher is about as successful as that of a celluloid dog chasing an asbestos cat through Hell."
The life of a conscientious clergyman is not easy. I have always considered a clergyman as the father of a larger family than he is able to maintain. I would rather have chancery suits upon my hands than the cure of souls.
The defects of a preacher are soon spied.
"Cleverness is serviceable for everything, sufficient for nothing."
Cleverness is not wisdom.
"Be good, sweet maid, and let who will be clever."
The clothes make the man.
"Whenas in silks my Julia goes, Then, then, methinks, how sweetly flows The liquefaction of her clothes!"
"Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy; For the apparel oft proclaims the man."
The soul of this man is his clothes.

"What is a committee? A group of the unwilling, picked from the unfit, to do the unnecessary."
"No grand idea was ever born in a conference, but a lot of foolish ideas have died there."
"Life is my college. May I graduate well, and earn some honors!"
College is the best time of your life. When else are your parents going to spend several thousand dollars a year just for you to go to a strange town and get drunk every night?
Those who go to college and never get out are called professors.

Colors speak all languages.
"Blue is true, Yellow's jealous, Green's forsaken, Red's brazen, White is love, And black is death."
More pernicious nonsense was never devised by man than treaties of commerce.
Commerce links all mankind in one common brotherhood of mutual dependence and interests.
Commerce is the equalizer of the wealth of nations.
Whatever has a tendency to promote the civil intercourse of nations by an exchange of benefits is a subject as worthy of philosophy as of politics.

A belief which does not spring from a conviction in the emotions is no belief at all.

"Many a man has walked up to the opportunity for which he has long been preparing himself, looked it full in the face, and then begun to get cold feet... when it comes to betting on yourself and your power to do the thing you know you must do or write yourself down a failure, you're a chicken-livered coward if you hesitate."
The wise man puts all his eggs in one basket and watches the basket.
"Poverty is uncomfortable, as I can testify: but nine times out of ten the best thing that can happen to a young man is to be tossed overboard and compelled to sink or swim for himself."
"Anytime you play golf for whatever you've got, that's pressure. I'd like to see H.L. Hunt go out there and play for $3 billion."
"There is a point at which everything becomes simple and there is no longer any question of choice, because all you have staked will be lost if you look back. Life's point of no return."
"Even now we can draw back. But once we cross that little bridge, we must settle things by the sword."
You don't know what pressure is until you play for $5 with only $2 in your pocket.
"The fixed determination to have acquired the warrior soul, to either conquer or perish with honor, is the secret of victory."
In war there is no substitute for victory.
"Victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory however long and hard the road may be; for without victory there is no survival."
Better that we should die fighting than be outraged and dishonored. Better to die than to live in slavery.
"I sincerely wish war was a pleasanter and easier business than it is, but it does not admit of holidays."
Every attempt to make war easy and safe will result in humiliation and disaster.
"If you start to take Vienna, take Vienna."
The worth of every conviction consists precisely in the steadfastness with which it is held.
"The moment one definitely commits oneself, the Providence moves, too. All sorts of things occur to help that would never otherwise have occurred. A stream of events issues from the decision, raising unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance, which no man could have dreamt would have come his way."
There is no strong performance without a little fanaticism in the performer.
"If you don't wake up with something in your stomach every day that makes you think, ""I want to make this movie,"" it'll never get made."
"We can do whatever we wish to do provided our wish is strong enough. But the tremendous effort needed- one doesn't always want to make it-does one? ... But what else can be done? What's the alternative? What do you want most to do? That's what I have to keep asking myself, in the face of difficulties."
I am a stranger to half measures.
Perform without fail what you resolve.
"To say yes, you have to sweat and roll up your sleeves and plunge both hands into life up to the elbows. It is easy to say no, even if saying no means death."
"What one has, one ought to use; and whatever he does, he should do with all his might."
Nothing's far when one wants to get there.
"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might."
He that rides his hobby gently must always give way to him that rides his hobby hard.
Stay up and really burn the midnight oil. There are no compromises.
"Nothing of worthy or weight can be achieved with half a mind, with a faint heart, and with a lame endeavor."
Don't ask me to give in to this body of mine. I can't afford it. Between me and my body there must be a struggle until death.
"Morality, like physical cleanliness, is not acquired once and for all: it can only be kept and renewed by a habit of constant watchfulness and discipline."
"Firmness of purpose is one of the most necessary sinews of character, and one of the best instruments of success. Without it, genius wastes its efforts in a maze of inconsistencies."
"My face is set, my gait is fast, my goal is Heaven, my road is narrow, my way is rough, my companions are few, my guide is reliable, my mission is clear. I cannot be bought, compromised, detoured, lured away, turned back, diluted, or delayed. I will not flinch in the face of sacrifice, hesitate in the presence of adversity, negotiate ... at the table of the enemy, ponder at the pool of popularity, or meander in a maze of mediocrity. I won't give up, shut up, let up, or slow up."
"To have no loyalty is to have no dignity, and in the end, no manhood."

"Never grow a wishbone, daughter, where your backbone ought to be."
Happy are those who dream dreams and are ready to pay the price to make them come true.
He turns not back who is bound to a star.
"One advantage of marriage, it seems to me, is that when you fall out of love with him, or he falls out of love with you, it keeps you together until you maybe fall in love again."
You can't try to do things; you simply must do them.
I am in earnest; I will not equivocate; I will not excuse; I will not retreat a single inch; and I will be heard.
"If you don't make a total commitment to whatever you're doing, then you start looking to bail out the first time the boat starts leaking. It's tough enough getting that boat to shore with everybody rowing, let alone when a guy stands up and starts putting his life jacket on."
"When I stand before God at the end of my life, I would hope that I would not have a single bit of talent left, and could say, ""I used everything you gave me."""
"It seems safe to say that significant discovery, really creative thinking, does not occur with regard to problems about which the thinker is lukewarm."
"If a man hasn't discovered something that he will die for, he isn't fit to live."
Moderation in war is imbecility.
"Let my name stand among those who are willing to bear ridicule and reproach for the truth's sake, and so earn some right to rejoice when the victory is won."
"Getting ahead in a difficult profession requires avid faith in yourself. You must be able to sustain yourself against staggering blows. There is no code of conduct to help beginners. That is why some people with mediocre talent, but with great inner drive, go much further than people with vastly superior talent."
"The wonderful thing about saints is that they were human. They lost their tempers, got hungry, scolded God, were egotistical or impatient in their turns, made mistakes and regretted them. Still they went on doggedly blundering toward heaven."
"A successful marriage requires falling in love many times, always with the same person."
Winners are men who have dedicated their whole lives to winning.
Those who love a cause are those who love the life which has to be led in order to serve it.
"Unless you can find some sort of loyalty, you cannot find unity and peace in your active living."
Sometimes success is due less to ability than zeal. The winner is he who gives himself to his work body and soul.
Now I am steel-set: I follow the call to the clear radiance and glow of the heights.
"Love me, please, I love you; I can bear to be your friend. So ask of me anything ... I am not a tentative person. Whatever I do, I give up my whole self to it."
I don't care a damn for your loyal service when you think I am right; when I really want it most is when you think I am wrong.
"One's lifework, I have learned, grows with the working and the living. Do it as if your life depended on it, and first thing you know, you'll have made a life out of it. A good life, too"
"If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything."
"If you deny yourself commitment, what can you do with your life?"
The person who makes a success of living is the one who sees his goal steadily and aims for it unswervingly. That is dedication.
"Theirs is not to reason why, theirs is but to do or die."
"Either do not attempt at all, or go through with it."

The height of your accomplishments will equal the depth of your convictions.
The dedicated life is the life worth living.
"The secret of living is to find a pivot, the pivot of a concept on which you can make your stand."
There's nothing in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead armadillos.
Standing in the middle of the road is very dangerous; you get knocked down by traffic from both sides.
He who walks in the middle of the road gets hit from both sides.
I never liked the middle ground-the most boring place in the world.
"The hottest places in hell are reserved for those who, in a period of moral crisis, maintain their neutrality."
The man who sees both sides of an issue is very likely on the fence or up a tree.
"The middle of the road is where the white line is, and that's the worst place to drive."
"The principle of neutrality ... has increasingly become an obsolete conception, and, except under very special circumstances, it is an immoral and shortsighted conception."
We know what happens to people who stay in the middle of the road. They get run over.
"Show me a person who is not an extremist about some things, who is a ""middle-of-the-roader"" in everything, and I will show you someone who is insecure."
We should not permit tolerance to degenerate into indifference.
"Most people are not for or against anything; the first object of getting people together is to make them respond somehow, to overcome inertia."
There is nothing harder than the softness of indifference.
"I could not, at any age, be content to take my place by the fireside and simply look on. Life was meant to be lived. Curiosity must be kept alive. One must never, for whatever reason, turn his back on life."
The accomplice to the crime of corruption is frequently our own indifference.
Science may have found a cure for most evils; but it has found no remedy for the worst of them all-the apathy of human beings.
The only difference between a rut and a grave is their dimensions.
We're swallowed up only when we are willing for it to happen.

Morale is the greatest single factor in successful wars.
Nothing can resist a will which will stake even existence upon its fulfillment.
"Our future and our fate lie in our wills more than in our hands, for our hands are but the instruments of our wills."

Strength is a matter of the made-up mind.
Your own resolution to success is more important than any other one thing.
Common sense is very uncommon.
"Common sense is in spite of, not the result of, education."
"Common sense is instinct, and enough of it is genius."
"What is a Communist? One who hath yearnings For equal division of unequal earnings, Idler or bungler, or both, he is willing, To fork out his copper and pocket your shilling."
The Communist is a Socialist in a violent hurry.
The theory of Communism may be summed up in one sentence: Abolish all private property.
"Communism is the exploitation of the strong by the weak. In communism, inequality springs from placing mediocrity on a level with excellence."
If you want to read about love and marriage you've got to buy two separate books.
"When you are in love with someone you want to be near him all the time, except when you are out buying things and charging them to him."
A happy marriage is a long conversation which always seems too short.
The first duty of love is to listen.
You don't marry someone you can live with - you marry the person who you cannot live without.
Behind every successful man is a surprised woman!
"Love is an act of endless forgiveness, a tender look which becomes a habit."
My most brilliant achievement was my ability to be able to persuade my wife to marry me.

Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies.
"I married the first man I ever kissed. When I tell this to my children, they just about throw up."
Love: Two minds without a single thought.
"Tenderness emerges from the fact that the two persons, longing, as all individuals do, to overcome the separateness and isolation to which we are all heir because we are individuals, can participate in a relationship that, for the moment, is not of two isolated selves but a union."
I recently read that love is entirely a matter of chemistry. That must be why my wife treats me like toxic waste.
"You can't put a price tag on love, but you can on all its accessories."
"When you love someone, all your saved-up wishes start coming out."
No man is truly married until he understands every word his wife is NOT saying.
To get the full value of joy you must have someone to divide it with.
"""The whole world loves a lover"" is an interesting theory, but a very bad legal defense."
I was married by a judge. I should have asked for a jury.
"They say love is blind . . . and marriage is an insritution. Well, I'm nor ready for an instirurion for rhe blind just yet."
I think men who have a pierced ear are better prepared for marriage. They've experienced pain and boughr jewelry.

"To keep the fire burning brightly there's one easy rule: Keep the two logs together, near enough to keep each other warm and far enough apart - about a finger's breadth - for breathing room. Good fire, good marriage, same rule."
Look for a sweet person. Forget rich.
Love seems the swiftest but it is the slowest of all growths. No man or woman really knows what perfect love is until they have been married a quarter of a century.
"One of the silliest lines ever said in a feature film came from Love Story, the 1970s hit, which immortalized the phrase, ""Love means never having to say you're sorry."" There are few people who would actually want to share a life with someone who held that concept near and dear."
"Infatuation is when you think he's as sexy as Robert Redford, as smart as Henry Kissinger, as noble as Ralph Nader, as funny as Woody Allen, and as athletic as Jimmy Conners. Love is when you realize that he's as sexy as Woody Allen, as smart as Jimmy Connors, as funny as Ralph Nader, as athletic as Henry Kissinger and nothing like Robert Redford - but you'll take him anyway."
"Without love, what are we worth? Eighty-nine cents! Eighty-nine cents worth of chemicals walking around lonely."
Love is the magician that pulls man out of his own hat.

"We waste time looking for the perfect lover, instead of creating the perfect love."
"Men love because they are afraid of themselves, afraid of the loneliness that lives in them, and need someone in whom they can lose themselves as smoke loses itself in the sky."
"When you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible."
"[Being in love] is something like poetry. Certainly, you can analyze it and expound its various senses and intentions, but there is always something left over, mysteriously hovering between music and meaning."
We are so fond of each other because our ailments are the same.
When I eventually met Mr. Right I had no idea that his first name was Always.

Of all the paths [that] lead to a woman's love Pity's the straightest.
"To see her is to love her, And love but her forever; For Nature made her what she is, And never made another."
"We have lived and loved together Through many changing years; We have shared each other's gladness, And wept each other's tears."
Being in therapy is great. I spend an hour just talking about myself. It's kinda like being the guy on a date.
"Whenever you want to marry someone, go have lunch with his ex-wife."
I sold my memoirs of my love life to Parker Brothers and they are going to make a game out of it.
"I have learned that only two things are necessary to keep one's wife happy. First, let her think she's having her own way. And second, let her have it."
Politics doesn't make strange bedfellows - marriage does.
"Someone asked me why women don't gamble as much as men do, and I gave the commonsensical reply that we don't have as much money. That was a true and incomplete answer. In fact, women's total instinct for gambling is satisfied by marriage."
The secret of a happy marriage remains a secret.
I've given my memoirs far more thought than any of my marriages. You can't divorce a book.
"Americans, who make more of marrying for love than any other people, also break up more of their marriages, but the figure reflects not so much the failure of love as the determination of people not to live without it."
The highest prize in a world of men is the most beautiful woman available on your arm and living there in her heart loyal to you.
Love is what makes two people sit in the middle of a bench when there is plenty of room at both ends.
"A man loves his sweetheart the most, his wife the best, but his mother the longest."
No woman ever falls in love with a man unless she has a better opinion of him than he deserves.
The bravest thing that men do is love women.
"A woman has to love a bad man once or twice in her life, to be thankful for a good one."
"Love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without. If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with? Fall head over heels. I say find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back. And how do you find him? Forget your head and listen to your heart."
"One of the things my life has taught me is how important it is to try to say, ""I love you"" in ways that can be preserved, looked at, and read when you are alone or when there is adversity or when circumstances bring separation. In any case, . . . saying ""I love you"" is one of the ""secrets"" of the happy marriage that Ronnie and I have shared. Ronnie's letters move me to this day. They are his gift to me across the years, and throughout the decades of love."
"The most wonderful of all things in life is the discovery of another human being with whom one's relationship has a growing depth, beauty and joy as the years increase. This inner progressiveness of love between two human beings is a most marvelous thing; it cannot be found by looking for it or by passionately wishing for it. It is a sort of divine accident, and the most wonderful of all things in life."
Tell me thy company and I will tell thee what thou art.
"Two's a company, three's a crowd."
We are in the same boat
The right hands of fellowship.
Comparisons are odious.
"Some say, compared to Bononcini, That Mynheer Handel's but a ninny; Others aver, that he to Handel Is scarcely fit to hold a candle: Strange all this difference should be, 'Twixt Tweedle-dum and Tweedle-dee!"
The bee and the serpent often sip from the selfsame flower.
"If the poor man cannot always get meat, the rich man cannot always digest it."
Tis always morning somewhere in the world.
Nothing is pure and entire of a piece. All advantages are attended with disadvantages. A universal compensation prevails in all conditions of being and existence.
The prickly thorn often bears soft roses.
Those who complain most are most to be complained of.
The usual fortune of complaint is to excite contempt more than pity.
Complaint is the largest tribute Heaven receives.
Compliments are only lies in court clothes.
"When two people compliment each other with the choice of anything, each of them generally gets that which he likes least."
"Compliments and flattery oftenest excite my contempt by the pretension they imply; for who is he that assumes to flatter me? To compliment often implies an assumption of superiority in the complimenter. It is, in fact, a subtle detraction."
"All government - indeed, every human benefit and enjoyment, every virtue and every prudent act - is founded on compromise and barter."
"Compromise makes a good umbrella, but a poor roof; it is a temporary expedient, often wise in party politics, almost sure to be unwise in statesmanship."
Better bend than break.
No man was ever so much deceived by another as by himself.
The art of making much show with little substance.
Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? There is more hope of a fool than of him.
The ability to concentrate and to use your time well is everything.
"It is only when I dally with what I am about, look back and aside, instead of keeping my eyes straight forward, that I feel these cold sinkings of the heart."
A straight path never leads anywhere except to the objective.
"Nothing interferes with my concentration. You could put on an orgy in my office and I wouldn't look up. Well, maybe once."
To be able to concentrate for a considerable time is essential to difficult achievement.
"If there is anything that can be called genius, it consists chiefly in the ability to give that attention to a subject which keeps it steadily in the mind, till we have surveyed it accurately on all sides."
"If you don't concentrate, you'll end up on your rear."
"If I have ever made any valuable discoveries, it has been owing more to patient attention than to any other talent."
"For him who has no concentration, there is no tranquility."
The secret to success in any human endeavor is total concentration.
"The secret of concentration is the secret of self-discovery. You reach inside yourself to discover your personal resources, and what it takes to match them to the challenge."
Beware of dissipating your powers; strive constantly to concentrate them.
One arrow does not bring down two birds.
"No horse gets anywhere until he is harnessed. No steam or gas ever drives anything until it is confined. No Niagara is ever turned into light and power until it is tunneled. No life ever grows great until it is focused, dedicated, disciplined."
A man may be so much of everything that he is nothing of everything.
"Concentrate your energies, your thoughts and your capital. ... The wise man puts all his eggs in one basket and watches the basket."
One man; two loves. No good ever comes of that.
One cannot both feast and become rich.
The perplexity of life arises from there being too many interesting things in it for us to be interested properly in any of them.
No country can act wisely simultaneously in every part of the globe at every moment of time.
The field of consciousness is tiny. It accepts only one problem at a time.
To do two things at once is to do neither.
"I like to laugh, but on the court, it is my work. I try to smile, but it is so difficult. I concentrate on the ball, not on my face."
"Successful minds work like a gimlet, to a single point."
A bird can roost but on one branch. A mouse can drink no more than its fill from a river.
"Each man is capable of doing one thing well. If he attempts several, he will fail to achieve distinction in any."
This one thing I do ... I press toward the mark.
"All good is gained by those whose thought and life are kept pointed close to one main thing, not scattered abroad upon a thousand."
"The first law of success ... is concentration: to bend all the energies to one point, and to go directly to that point, looking neither to the right nor the left."
"Give me a man who says this one thing I do, and not these fifty things I dabble in."
"A single idea, if it is right, saves us the labor of an infinity of experiences."
One thought driven home is better than three left on base.
Purity of heart is to will one thing.
"A man should remove not only unnecessary acts, but also unnecessary thoughts, for then superfluous activity will not follow."
No man will swim ashore and take his baggage with him.
"Many people who wonder why they don't amount to more than they do have good stuff in them, and are energetic, persevering, and have ample opportunities. It is all a case of trimming the useless branches and throwing the whole force of power into the development of something that counts."
"A great man is one who seizes the vital issue in a complex question, what we might call the jugular vein of the whole organism, and spends his energies upon that."
While the work or play is on ... don't constantly feel you ought to be doing the other.
"When one is learning, one should not think of play; and when one is at play, one should not think of learning."
The immature mind hops from one thing to another; the mature mind seeks to follow through.
"If you want to hit a bird on the wing you must have all your will in focus, you must not be thinking about yourself and, equally, you must not be thinking about your neighbor: you must be living in your eye on that bird. Every achievement is a bird on the wing."
"The difference in men does not lie in the size of their hands, nor in the perfection of their bodies, but in this one sublime ability of concentration: to throw the weight with the blow, to live an eternity in an hour."
I go at what I am about as if there was nothing else in the world for the time being.
"Choice of attention, to pay attention to this and ignore that, is to the inner life what choice of action is to the outer."
"Concentration is everything. On the day I'm performing, I don't hear anything anyone says to me."
The real essence of work is concentrated energy.
"You can't ring the bells and, at the same time, walk in the procession."
"I've learned ruthless concentration. I can write under any circumstances ... street noises, loud talk, music, you name it."
Do whatever you do intensely.
The effectiveness of work increases according to geometrical progression if there are no interruptions.
Other people's interruptions of your work are relatively insignificant compared with the countless times you interrupt yourself.
"If you direct your whole thought to work itself, none of the things which invade eyes or ears will reach the mind."
A full mind is an empty baseball bat.
There is time enough for everything in the course of the day if you do but one thing at once; but there is not time enough in the year if you will do two things at a time.
"If you direct your whole thought to work itself, none of the things which invade eyes or ears will reach the mind."
Become so wrapped up in something that you forget to be afraid.
Attention to a subject depends upon our interest in it.
I can't concentrate on golf or bowling. Those bowling pins aren't going to hurt me. I can concentrate in the ring because someone is trying to kill me.
"When I come into a game in the bottom of the ninth, bases loaded, no one out and a one-run lead ... it takes people off my mind."
"Concentrate on finding your goal, then concentrate on reaching it."
Those who set out to serve both God and Mammon soon discover that there is no God.

"The integrity of men is to be measured by their conduct, not by their professions."
Open confession is good for the soul.
To confess a fault freely is the next thing to being innocent of it.
The confidence which we have in ourselves gives birth to much of that which we have in others.
Society is built upon trust.
"Be courteous to all, but intimate with few; and let those few be well tried before you give them your confidence."
"Every man in it is a great man, an orator, a critic, a statesman; and therefore every man upon every question must show his oratory, his criticism, and his political abilities."
Fleas can be taught nearly anything that a Congressman can.
"Some statesmen go to Congress and some go to jail. It is the same thing, after all."
"How grand is victory, but how dear!"
He who surpasses or subdues mankind must look down on the hate of those below.
"I came, I saw, I conquered."
To rejoice in conquest is to rejoice in murder.
Self-conquest is the greatest of victories.
Conscience is a mother-in-law whose visit never ends.
Conscience is a cur that will let you get past it but that you cannot keep from barking.
"Conscience is but a word that cowards use, Devised at first to keep the strong in awe."
Conscience reigns but it does not govern.
A man's vanity tells him what is honour; a man's conscience what is justice.
Conscience does make cowards of us all.
"Conscience is thoroughly well-bred, and soon leaves off talking to those who do not wish to hear it."
"Conscience is a coward, and those faults it has not strength enough to prevent, it seldom has justice enough to accuse."
I feel bad that I don't feel worse.
Shame arises from the fear of man; conscience from the fear of God.
Nor ear can hear nor tongue can tell The tortures of that inward hell!
The only incorruptible thing about us.
Liberty of conscience (when people have consciences) is rightly considered the most indispensable of liberties.
There is no pillow so soft as a clear conscience.
Conscience is a sacred sanctuary where God alone may enter as judge.
"I am more afraid of my own heart than of the pope and all his cardinals. I have within me the great pope, self."
"Thus conscience does make cowards of us all; And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought; And enterprises of great pith and moment, With this regard, their currents turn awry, And lose the name of action."
The soft whispers of the God in man.
"A statesman who is enamored of existing evils, as distin-quished from the Liberal, who wishes to replace them with others."
"We are reformers in spring and summer; in autumn and winter we stand by the old; reformers in the morning, conservers at night. Reform is affirmative, conservatism negative; conservatism goes for comfort, reform for truth."
"A conservative is a man who will not look at the new moon, out of respect for that ""ancient institution,"" the old one."
"What is conservatism? Is it not adherence to the old and tried, against the new and untried?"
Inconsistency is the only thing in which men are consistent.
Nothing that is not a real crime makes a man appear so contemptible and little in the eyes of the world as inconsistency.
Like all weak men he laid an exaggerated stress on not changing one's mind.
"A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words and tomorrow speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict everything you said today."
Consistency requires you to be as ignorant today as you were a year ago.
Consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative.
Conservatism is the maintenance of conventions already in force.
"There are those who would misteach us that to stick in a rut is consistency - and a virtue, and that to climb out of the rut is inconsistency - and a vice."
"People who honestly mean to be true, really contradict themselves much more rarely than those who try to be 'consistent'."
The only man who can change his mind is the man who's got one.
"A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines."
Inconsistency is the only thing in which men are consistent.
"Shoemaker, stick to your last."
"Constitutions should consist only of general provisions; the reason is that they must necessarily be permanent, and that they cannot calculate for the possible change of things."
"We are under a Constitution, but the Constitution is what the judges say it is."
"In questions of power let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the constitution."
A good constitution is infinitely better than the best despot.
Enjoy your own life without comparing it with that of another.
"I earn that I eat, get that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's happiness; glad of other men's good, content with my harm."
He is well paid that is well satisfied.
It is not for man to rest in absolute contentment.
"No great advance has ever been made in science, politics, or religion, without controversy."
"If a cause be good, the most violent attack of its enemies will not injure it so much as an injudicious defense of it by its friends."
Conversation is the fine art of mutual consideration and communication about matters of common interest that basically have some human importance.
"Great talkers are trying to fill the gap between themselves and others, but only widen it."
Half the world is composed of people who have something to say and can't and the other half who have nothing to say and keep on saying it.
Pollution is nothing but the resources we are not harvesting. We allow them to disperse because we have been ignorant of their value.
Speech is civilization itself.
The habit of common and continuous speech is a symptom of mental deficiency. It proceeds from not knowing what is going on in other people's minds.
The time to stop talking is when the other person nods his head affirmatively but says nothing.
There is no such thing as conversation. It is an illusion. There are intersecting monologues. That is all.
"He was one of those men whose constitutional inability to make small talk forfeits all one's sympathy, and makes one think that social grace is sometimes a moral duty."
He (Macaulay) has occasional flashes of silence that make his conversation perfectly delightful.
"As I got warmed up, and felt perfectly at home in talk, I heard myself boasting, lying, exaggerating. Oh, not deliberately, far from it. It would be unconvivial and dull to stop and arrest the flow of talk, and speak only after carefully considering whether I was telling the truth."
Men always talk about the most important things to perfect strangers.
Not a sentence or a word is independent of the circumstances under which it is uttered.
Communication is and should be hell fire and sparks as well as sweetness and light.
The really important things are said over cocktails and are never done.
"You never say a word of yourself, dear Lady Grey. You have that dreadful sin of anti-egotism."
The real art of conversation is not only to say the right thing in the right place but to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment.
Listen or thy tongue will keep thee deaf.
"People love to talk but hate to listen. Listening is not merely not talking, though even that is beyond most of our powers; it means taking a vigorous, human interest in what is being told us. You can listen like a blank wall or like a splendid auditorium where every sound comes back fuller and richer."
A man who listens because he has nothing to say can hardly be a source of inspiration. The only listening that counts is that of the talker who alternately absorbs and expresses ideas.
"When I think over what I have said, I envy dumb people."
"That is the happiest conversation where there is no competition, no vanity, but a calm quiet interchange of sentiments."
"John Wesley's conversation is good, but he is never at leisure. He is always obliged to go at a certain hour. This is very disagreeable to a man who loves to fold his legs and have his talk out as I do."
"She had lost the art of conversation, but not, unfortunately, the power of speech."
Too much agreement kills a chat.
You can never hope to become a skilled conversationalist until you learn how to put your foot tactfully through the television set.
Some persons talk simply because they think sound is more manageable than silence.
"While the right to talk may be the beginning of freedom, the necessity of listening is what makes the right important."
"Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. The friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward, and we want to sit in their radius. When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand."
"A ceremony of self-wastage - good talkers are miserable, they know that they have betrayed themselves, that they have taken material which should have a life of its own, to disperse it in noises upon the air."
"Wit is the salt of conversation, not the food."
Debate is masculine; conversation is feminine.
"Never hold any one by the button or the hand in order to be heard out; for if people are unwilling to hear you, you had better hold your tongue than them."
"Conversation enriches the understanding, but solitude is the school of genius."
Silence is one great art of conversation.
Conceit causes more conversation than wit.
The less men think; the more they talk.
A conservative believes nothing should be done for the first time.
"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."
"Genuine blasphemy, genuine in spirit and not purely verbal, is the product of partial belief, and is as impossible to the complete atheist as to the perfect Christian."
"I believe in the gods. Or rather, I believe that I believe in the gods. But I don't believe that they are great brooding presences watching over us; I believe they are completely absent-minded."
I think that a society cannot live without a certain number of irrational beliefs. They are protected from criticism and analysis because they are irrational.
"What is dangerous about extremists is not that they are extreme, but that they are intolerant. The evil is not what they say about their cause, but what they say about their opponents."
"It is a perplexing and unpleasant truth that when men already have 'something worth fighting for', they do not feel like fighting."
"Martyrdom has always been a proof of the intensity, never of the correctness of a belief."
"Belief is better than anything else, and it is best when rapt - above paying its respects to anybody's doubt whatsoever."
The peak of tolerance is most readily achieved by those who are not burdened with convictions.
A belief is not merely an idea the mind possesses; it is an idea that possesses the mind.
"Every man who attacks my belief diminishes in some degree my confidence in it, and therefore makes me uneasy, and I am angry with him who makes me uneasy."
"Penetrating so many secrets, we cease to believe in the unknowable. But there it sits nevertheless, calmly licking its chops."
"Believe not your own brother - believe, instead, your own blind eye."
Whether you are really right or not doesn't matter; it's the belief that counts.
I love an opposition that has convictions.
"Every man, wherever he goes, is encompassed by a cloud of comforting convictions, which move with him like flies on a summer day."
"Convictions are the mainsprings of action, the driving powers of life. What a man lives are his convictions."
"The best lack all conviction, while the worst Are full of passionate intensity."
"(Conviction) is possible only in a world more primitive than ours can be perceived to be. A man can achieve a simply gnomic conviction only by ignoring the radical describers of his environment, or by hating them, as convinced men have hated, say, Darwin and Freud, as agents of some devil."
"Those who serve a cause are not those who love that cause. They are those who love the life which has to be led in order to serve it - except in the case of the very purest, and they are rare."
"The great thing in this world is not so much where we stand, as in what direction we are moving."
Orthodoxy is my doxy - heterodoxy is another man's doxy.
Every dogma has its day.
"A man can believe in a considerable deal of rubbish, and yet go about his daily work in a rational and cheerful manner."
"Every life is a possession of faith, and exercises an inevitable and silent propaganda."
Soon after a hard decision something inevitably occurs to cast doubt. Holding steady against that doubt usually proves the decision.
I may have faults but being wrong ain't one of them.
The discovery of a new dish does more for human happiness than the discovery of a new star.
We may live without friends; we may live without books; But civilized man cannot live without cooks.
Too many cooks spoil the broth.
"God sends meat, and the Devil sends cooks."
A conservative believes nothing should be done for the first time.
"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."
"Genuine blasphemy, genuine in spirit and not purely verbal, is the product of partial belief, and is as impossible to the complete atheist as to the perfect Christian."

But if you get into the habit of making decisions, experience will develop your judgment to a point where more and more of your decisions will be right. After all, it is better to be right 51 percent of the time and get something done, than it is to get nothing done because you fear to reach a decision."
"Decide on what you think is right, and stick to it."
"Continually one faces the horrible matter of making decisions. The solution ... is, as far as possible, to avoid conscious rational decisions and choices; simply to do what you find yourself doing; to float in the great current of life with as little friction as possible; to allow things to settle themselves, as indeed they do with the most infallible certainty."
"When making a decision of minor importance, I have always found it advantageous to consider all the pros and cons. In vital matters, however, such as the choice of a mate or a profession, the decision should come from the unconscious, from somewhere within ourselves. In the important decisions of personal life, we should be governed, I think, by the deep inner needs of our nature."
"Pick battles big enough to matter, small enough to win."
Wisdom consists in being able to distinguish among dangers and make a choice of the least harmful.
"I think we should follow a simple rule: if we can take the worst, take the risk."
Human foresight often leaves its proudest possessor only a choice of evils.
"When one bases his life on principle, 99 percent of his decisions are already made."
"The best we can do is size up the chances, calculate the risks involved, estimate our ability to deal with them, and then make our plans with confidence."
"In case of doubt, decide in favor of what is correct."
"Each man must for himself alone decide what is right and what is wrong, which course is patriotic and which isn't. You cannot shirk this and be a man. To decide against your conviction is to be an unqualified and inexcusable traitor, both to yourself and to your country, let men label you as they may."
"People ""died"" all the time. ... Parts of them died when they made the wrong kinds of decisions-decisions against life. Sometimes they died bit by bit until finally they were just living corpses walking around. If you were perceptive you could see it in their eyes; the fire had gone out ... you always knew when you made a decision against life. ... The door clicked and you were safe inside- safe and dead."
"What I emphasize is for people to make choices based not on fear, but on what really gives them a sense of fulfillment."
"We lose the fear of making decisions, great and small, as we realize that should our choice prove wrong we can, if we will, learn from the experience."
History is a stern judge.
I get a little angry about this highhanded scrapping of the look of things. What else have we to go by? How else can the average person form an opinion of a girl's sense of values or even of her chastity except by the looks of her conduct?
"You wouldn't want to be caught wearing cheap perfume, would you? Then why do you want to wear cheap perfume on your conduct?"
The difference between weakness and wickedness is much less than people suppose; and the consequences are nearly always the same.
"Authority without wisdom is like a heavy axe without an edge, fitter to bruise than to polish."
One faces the future with one's past.
"Our deeds still travel with us from afar, and what we have been makes us what we are."
"You must not change one thing, one pebble, one grain of sand, until you know what good and evil will follow on that act."
The beginning of compunction is the beginning of a new life.
"The Pilgrims didn't have any experience when they landed here. Hell, if experience was that important, we'd never have anybody walking on the moon."
"Each person has a literature inside them. But when people lose language, when they have to experiment with putting their thoughts together on the spot-that's what I love most. That's where character lives."
There is no data on the future.
The most important fact about Spaceship Earth: an instruction book didn't come with it.
"Life is the only art that we are required to practice without preparation, and without being allowed the preliminary trials, the failures and botches, that are essential for the training of a mere beginner."
Time has told me less than I need to know.
I learn by going where I have to go.
Life is like playing a violin in public and learning the instrument as one goes on.
We don't have enough time to premeditate all our actions.
"Every year, if not every day, we have to wager our salvation upon some prophecy based upon imperfect knowledge."
"Faith ... acts promptly and boldly on the occasion, on slender evidence."
A decision is an action you must take when you have information so incomplete that the answer does not suggest itself.
"She knew in her heart that to be without optimism, that core of reasonless hope in the spirit, rather than the brain, was a fatal flaw, the seed of death."
When faith is supported by facts or by logic it ceases to be faith.
How far would Moses have gone if he had taken a poll in Egypt?
Better to be without logic than without feeling.
The will to be totally rational is the will to be made out of glass and steel: and to use others as if they were glass and steel.
"In the three years I played ball, we won six, lost seventeen and tied two. Some statistician ... calculated that we won 75 percent of the games we didn't lose."
"Imagination took the reins, and Reason, slow-paced, though surefooted, was unequal to a race with so eccentric and flighty a companion."
Many persons of high intelligence have notoriously poor judgement.
How dangerous can false reasoning prove!
The tendency of modern science is to reduce proof to absurdity by continually reducing absurdity to proof.
"Say you were standing with one foot in the oven and one foot in an ice bucket. According to the percentage people, you would be perfectly comfortable."
Logic is the art of going wrong with confidence.
"Reason, with most people, means their own opinions."
Logic pervades the world; the limits of the world are also the limits of logic.
"Man is a reasoning, rather than a reasonable, animal."
False conclusions which have been reasoned out are infinitely worse than blind impulse.
"If you do everything you should do, and do not do anything you should not do, you will, according to the best available statistics, live exactly eighteen hours longer than you would otherwise."
"Decisions, particularly important ones, have always made me sleepy, perhaps because I know that I will have to make them by instinct, and thinking things out is only what other people tell me I should do."
Statistics are no substitute for judgement.
It is the heart always that sees before the head can see.
"Facts are stubborn things, but statistics are more pliable."
A true history of human events would show that a far larger proportion of our acts are the result of sudden impulse and accident than of that reason of which we so much boast.
"It is always thus, impaled by a state of mind which is destined not to last, that we make our irrevocable decisions."
A power greater than any human being helped make this decision.
He who reflects too much will achieve little.
The opportunity is often lost by deliberating.
"The percentage of mistakes in quick decisions is no greater than in long-drawn-out vacillations, and the effect of decisiveness itself ""makes things go"" and creates confidence."
Deliberation often loses a good chance.
The mania of thinking renders one unfit for every activity.
"When possible make the decisions now, even if action is in the future. A revised decision usually is better than one reached at the last moment."
"We spend our days in deliberating, and we end them without coming to any resolve."
"If you think too long, you think wrong."
"You decide you'll wait for your pitch. Then as the ball starts toward the plate, you think about your stance. And then you think about your swing. And then you realize that the ball that went past you for a strike was your pitch."
The soul of dispatch is decision.
"The moment a question comes to your mind, see yourself mentally taking hold of it and disposing of it. In that moment... you learn to become the decider and not the vacillator. Thus you build character."
"So what do we do? Anything. Something. So long as we just don't sit there. If we screw it up, start over. Try something else. If we wait until we've satisfied all the uncertainties, it may be too late."
Often greater risk is involved in postponement than in making a wrong decision.
Some persons are very decisive when it comes to avoiding decisions.
"Do not wait for ideal circumstances, nor the best opportunities; they will never come."
"There comes a time when you've got to say, ""Let's get off our asses and go ..."" I have always found that if I move with 75 percent or more of the facts I usually never regret it. It's the guys who wait to have everything perfect that drive you crazy."
Conditions are never just right. People who delay action until all factors are favorable do nothing.
"Common sense does not ask an impossible chessboard, but takes the one before it and plays the game."
He who postpones the hour of living is like the rustic who waits for the river to run out before he crosses.
If you wait for inspiration you'll be standing on the corner after the parade is a mile down the street.
Nothing at all will be attempted if all possible objections must first be overcome.
It is the characteristic excellence of the strong man that he can bring momentous issues to the fore and make a decision about them. The weak are always forced to decide between alternatives they have not chosen themselves.
"Alternatives, and particularly desirable alternatives, grow only on imaginary trees."
"The more one does and sees and feels, the more one is able to do, and the more genuine may be one's own appreciation of fundamental things like home, and love, and understanding companionship."
"Our danger is not too few, but too many options ... to be puzzled by innumerable alternatives."
The absence of alternatives clears the mind marvelously.
"I couldn't claim that I have never felt the urge to explore evil, but when you descend into hell you have to be very careful."
"If decisions were a choice between alternatives, decisions would come easy. Decision is the selection and formulation of alternatives."
You cannot have your cake and eat it.
"It is better to arm and strengthen your hero, than to disarm and enfeeble your foe."
You cannot sell the cow and sup the milk.
There is only one answer to destruc-tiveness and that is creativity.
A door must either be shut or open.
Here's a rule I recommend. Never practice two vices at once.
You cannot serve God and Mammon.
Between two stools one sits on the ground.
"When you cannot make up your mind between two evenly balanced courses of action, choose the bolder."
"When confronted with two courses of action I jot down on a piece of paper all the arguments in favor of each one, then on the opposite side I write the arguments against each one. Then by weighing the arguments pro and con and cancelling them out, one against the other, I take the course indicated by what remains."
There are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it.
You cannot have it both ways.
"I would sort out all the arguments and see which belonged to fear and which to creativeness. Other things being equal, I would make the decision which had the larger number of creative reasons on its side."
"Of two evils, choose the less."
"Of two evils, choose the prettier."
"Where bad's the best, bad must be the choice."
"Both choices are painful, but only one is therapeutic."
God offers to every mind its choice between truth and repose. Take which you please-you can never have both.
Necessity relieves us from the embarrassment of choice.
"When you have to make a choice and don't make it, that is in itself a choice."
"A man without decision can never be said to belong to himself; he is as a wave of the sea, or a feather in the air which every breeze blows about."
"Nothing is so exhausting as indecision, and nothing is so futile."
Not to decide is to decide.
"Decision is a sharp knife that cuts clean and straight; indecision, a dull one that hacks and tears and leaves ragged edges behind it."
There is no more miserable human being than one in whom nothing is habitual but indecision.
"In not making the decision, you've made one. Not doing something is the same as doing it."
"There is a time when we must firmly choose the course we will follow, or the relentless drift of events will make the decision for us."
You can only predict things after they've happened.
"It is the mark of a good action that it appears inevitable, in retrospect."
No one knows what he can to do until he tries.
"Of all paths a man could strike into, there is, at any given moment, a best path which, here and now, it were of all things wisest for him to do. To find this path, and walk in it, is the one thing needful for him."
"Decisions, particularly important ones, have always made me sleepy, perhaps because I know that I will have to make them by instinct, and thinking things out is only what other people tell me I should do."
"After a battle is over people talk a lot about how decisions were methodically reached, but actually there's always a hell of a lot of groping around."
No question is ever settled until it is settled right.
"No man who has not sat in the assemblies of men can know the light, odd and uncertain ways in which decisions are often arrived at."
No trumpets sound when the important decisions of our life are made. Destiny is made known silently.
"A man must be able to cut a knot, for everything cannot be untied."
Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide ... And the choice goes by forever t'wixt that darkness and that light.
"Necessity is not an established fact, but an interpretation."
We are not permitted to choose the frame of our destiny. But what we put into it is ours.
"There is a point at which everything becomes simple and there is no longer any question of choice, because all you have staked will be lost if you look back. Life's point of no return."
Optimism is an intellectual choice.
"The lame man who keeps the right road outstrips the runner who takes a wrong one ... the more active and swift the latter is, the further he will go astray."
"Nothing is more difficult, and therefore more precious, than to be able to decide."
"There is one quality more important than know-how.... This is know-how by which we determine not only how to accomplish our purposes, but what our purposes are to be."
"Destiny is not a matter of chance, it is a matter of choice; it is not a thing to be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved."
"What must be, shall be; and that which is a necessity to him that struggles is little more than choice to him that is willing."
"A wiser rule would be to make up your mind soberly what you want, peace or war, and then to get ready for what you want; for what we prepare for is what we shall get."
We have resolved to endure the unendurable and suffer what is insufferable.
"Once a decision was made, I did not worry about it afterward."
No country can act wisely simultaneously in every part of the globe at every moment of time.
"The last, if not the greatest, of the human freedoms: to choose their own attitude in any given circumstance."
He who has a choice has trouble.
We have left undone those things which we ought to have done; and we have done those things which we ought not to have done.
"Little deeds of kindness, little words of love, Make our earth an Eden like the heaven above."
Whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well.
Give me the ready hand rather than the ready tongue.
Noble deeds that are concealed are most esteemed.
Heaven ne'er helps the man who will not help himself.
Do not be afraid of defeat. You are never so near to victory as when defeated in a good cause.
To lose Is to learn.
"We have fought this fight as long, and as well as we know how. We have been defeated. For us, as a Christian people, there is now but one course to pursue. We must accept the situation."
"I let the American people down, and I have to carry that burden for the rest of my life. My political life is over. I will never again have an opportunity to serve in any official position. Maybe I can give a little advice from time to time."
"What is defeat? Nothing but education, nothing but the first step toward something better."
"Who, apart From ourselves, can see any difference between Our victories and our defeats?"
"They were never defeated, they were only killed."
The mountain remains unmoved at seeming defeat by the mist.
It is defeat that turns bone to flint; it is defeat that turns gristle to muscle; it is defeat that makes men invincible.
"What is defeat? Nothing but education, nothing but the first step to something better."
Defeat should never be a source of discouragement but rather a fresh stimulus.
"Demagogues and agitators are very unpleasant, but they are incidents to a free and constitutional country, and you must put up with these inconveniences or do without many important advantages."
In every age the vilest specimens of human nature are to be found among demagogues.
"Every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them."
A wise fellow who is also worthless always charms the rabble.
Democracy is based upon the conviction that there are extraordinary possibilities in ordinary people.
"In a democracy, the opposition is not only tolerated as constitutional, but must be maintained because it is indispensable."
It has been said that Democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.
"Democracy is based on the conviction that man has the moral and intellectual capacity, as well as the inalienable right, to govern himself with reason and justice."
"If you want to understand democracy, spend less time in the library with Plato, and more time in the buses with people."
"Democracy is a small hard core of common agreement, surrounded by a rich variety of individual differences."
"People often say that, in a democracy, decisions are made by a majority of the people. Of course, that is not true. Decisions are made by a majority of those who make themselves heard and who vote - a very different thing."
"Democracy means government by the uneducated, while aristocracy means government by the badly educated."
My definition of a free society is a society where it is safe to be unpopular.
It is the greatest good to the greatest number which is the measure of right and wrong.
"The greatest blessing of our democracy is freedom. But in the last analysis, our only freedom is the freedom to discipline ourselves."
Democracy is the recurrent suspicion that more than half of the people are right more than half of the time.
The worst form of inequality is to try to make unequal things equal.
"What men value in the world is not rights, but privileges."
"As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This expresses my idea of democracy."
Democracy is a festival of mediocrity.
The job of a citizen is to keep his mouth open.
"It would be folly to argue that the people cannot make political mistakes. They can and do make grave mistakes. They know it, they pay the penalty, but compared with the mistakes which have been made by every kind of autocracy they are unimportant."
Democracy is based upon the conviction that there are extraordinary possibilities in ordinary people.
The world must be made safe for democracy.
"Democracy is the government of the people, by the people, for the people."
"Democracy means not ""I am as good as you are,"" but ""You are as good as I am."""
All the ills of democracy can be cured by more democracy.
I believe in Democracy because it releases the energies of every human being.
"While democracy must have its organization and controls, its vital breath is individual liberty."
"People may live as much retired from the world as they please; but sooner or later, before they are aware, they will find themselves debtor or creditor to somebody."
He who imagines he can do without the world deceives himself much; but he who fancies the world cannot do without him is still more mistaken.
It is easier to suppress the first desire than to satisfy all that follow it.
There are two tragedies in life. One is not to get your heart's desire. The other is to get it.
Our desires always increase with our possessions. The knowledge that something remains yet unenjoyed impairs our enjoyment of the good before us.
He who desires naught will always be free.
"Ah love! could you and I with Him conspire To grasp this sorry scheme of things entire, Would not we shatter it to bits - and then Re-mold it nearer to the heart's desire!"
"Ail hope abandon, ye who enter here."
Despair is the conclusion of fools.
Despair doubles our strength.
It is the old practice of despots to use a part of the people to keep the rest in order.
Despotism can no more exist in a nation until the liberty of the press be destroyed than the night can happen before the sun is set.
"I will believe in the right of one man to govern a nation despotically when I find a man born unto the world with boots and spurs, and a nation with saddles on their backs."
"We are but as the instrument of Heaven. Our work is not design, but destiny."
Every man meets his Waterloo at last.
"There is a divinity that shapes our ends, Rough-hew them how we will."
Here is the devil-and-all to pay.
"Resist the Devil, and he will flee from you."
"The devil was sick, the devil a monk would be; The devil was well, the devil a monk was he."
"How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!"
"Get thee behind me, Satan."
He will give the devil his due.
The prince of darkness is a gentleman.
The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
"Everyone gets their rough day. No one gets a free ride. Today so far, I had a good day. I got a dial tone."
"Thy fate is the common fate of all, Into each life some rain must fall, Some days must be dark and dreary."
Some days you tame the tiger. And some days the tiger has you for lunch.
Some days the dragon wins.
"The one law that does not change is that everything changes, and the hardship I was bearing today was only a breath away from the pleasures I would have tomorrow, and those pleasures would be all the richer because of the memories of this I was enduring."
"Experience cold or heat, pleasure or pain. These experiences are fleeting; they come and go. Bear them patiently."
"To everything there is a season, A time for every purpose under heaven.... A time to weep, and a time to laugh, A time to mourn, and a time to dance."
"Let nothing disturb thee, Let nothing affright thee, All things are passing, God changeth never."
"This, too, shall pass."
The present will not long endure.
"We do not live an equal life, but one of contrasts and patchwork; now a little joy, then a sorrow, now a sin, then a generous or brave action."
"I feel successful when the writing goes well. This lasts five minutes. Once, when I was number one on the bestseller list, I also felt successful. That lasted three minutes."
Sadness and gladness succeed each other.
Sadness flies away on the wings of time.
"I don't think that ... one gets a flash of happiness once, and never again; it is there within you, and it will come as certainly as death...."
"Life comes in clusters, clusters of solitude, then clusters when there is hardly time to breathe."
"If winter comes, can spring be far behind?"
Human misery must somewhere have a stop; there is no wind that always blows a storm.
No winter lasts forever; no spring skips its turn.
There are trees that seem to die at the end of autumn. There are also the evergreens.
"Our Lord has written the promise of resurrection, not in books alone, but in every leaf in springtime."
"For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; the flowers appear on the earth."
"If matters go badly now, they will not always be so."
Pain is never permanent.
You will suffer and you will hurt. You will have joy and you will have peace.
"Pain is part of being alive, and we need to learn that. Pain does not last forever, nor is it necessarily unbearable, and we need to be taught that."
"Pain is hard to bear.... But with patience, day by day, Even this shall pass away."
Everything in life that we really accept undergoes a change. So suffering must become love. That is the mystery.
"I've been failing for, like, ten or eleven years. When it turns, it'll turn. Right now I'm just tryin' to squeeze through a very tight financial period, get the movie out, and put my things in order."
"I've never been poor, only broke. Being poor is a frame of mind. Being broke is a temporary situation."
In the darkest hour the soul is replenished and given strength to continue and endure.
He that can't endure the bad will not live to see the good.
"Our toil is sweet with thankfulness, Our burden is our boon; The curse of earth's gray morning is The blessing of its noon."
"Were it possible for us to see further than our knowledge reaches, perhaps we would endure our sadnesses with greater confidence than our joys. For they are moments when something new has entered into us, something unknown."
"We may draw good outof evil; we must not do evil, that good may come."
You will find a joy in overcoming obstacles.
What we call the beginning is often an end. And to make an end is to make a beginning. The end is where we start from.
"When one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us."
Death is a door life opens.
"The world is round, and the place which may seem like the end may also be only the beginning."
Perhaps someday it will be pleasant to remember even this.
One day in retrospect the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful.
The crisis of today is the joke of tomorrow.
Sadness flies away on the wings of time.
Sometimes I found that in my happy moments I could not believe that I had ever been miserable.
"If our education had included training to bear unpleasantness and to let the first shock pass until we could think more calmly, many an unbearable situation would become manageable, and many a nervous illness avoided. There is a proverb expressing this. It says, trouble is a tunnel through which we pass and not a brick wall against which we must break our head."
"Time, in the turning-over of days, works change, for better or worse."
Experience is what really happens to you in the long run; the truth that finally overtakes you.
"Time is like a river of fleeting events, and its current is strong; as soon as something comes into sight, it is swept past us, and something else takes its place, and that too will be swept away."
"Time cools, time clarifies; no mood can be maintained quite unaltered through the course of hours."
Time bears away all things.
"Come what come may, time and the hour runs through the roughest day."
Time brings all things to pass.
"We undo ourselves by impatience. Misfortunes have their life and their limits, their sickness and their health."
"The future is something which everyone reaches at the rate of sixty minutes an hour, whatever he does, whoever he is."
That's the advantage of having lived sixty-five years. You don't feel the need to be impatient any longer.
Who longest waits most surely wins.
"Patience is a bitter plant, but it has sweet fruit."
No emergency excuses you from exercising tolerance.
I believe the sign of maturity is accepting deferred gratification.
He that can have patience can have what he will.
"Being human, we should bear all we can."
"Adopt the pace of nature, her secret is patience."
You can't have genius without patience.
The most potent and sacred command which can be laid upon any artist is the command: wait.
How poor are they that have not patience? What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
All things come round to him who will but wait.
Panic is not an effective long-term organizing strategy.
"Self-denial is painful for a moment, but very agreeable in the end."
"And he shall reign a goodly king And sway his hand o'er every clime With peace writ on his signet ring, Who bides his time."
It takes time to succeed because success is merely the natural reward of taking time to do anything well.
Patience and fortitude conquer all things.
"Be not afraid of growing slowly, be afraid only of standing still."
Wisely and slow. They stumble that run fast.
"No great thing is created suddenly, any more than a bunch of grapes or a fig. If you tell me that you desire a fig, I answer you that there must be time. Let it first blossom, then bear fruit, then ripen."
Time deals gently only with those who take it gently.
Hold on; hold fast; hold out. Patience is genius.
Genius is nothing but a greater aptitude for patience.
All human wisdom is summed up in two words: wait and hope.
Genius is eternal patience.
Serene I fold my hands and wait.
"The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong."
Everything comes if a man will only wait.
Everything comes to him who hustles while he waits.
The secret of patience ... to do something else in the meantime.
"Have patience with all things, but chiefly have patience with yourself. Do not lose courage in considering your own imperfections, but instantly set about remedying them-every day begin the task anew."
"Let us then be up and doing, With a heart for any fate, Still achieving, still pursuing, Learn to labor and to wait."
God will wait as long as it takes for us.
Waiting is not mere empty hoping. It has the inner certainty of reaching the goal.
All things come to him who waits- provided he knows what he is waiting for.
"Hope and patience are two sovereign remedies for all, the surest reposals, the softest cushions to lean on in adversity."
The strongest of all warriors are these two-Time and Patience.
Who bides his time tastes the sweet Of honey in the saltiest tear; And though he fares with slowest feet Joy runs to meet him drawing near.
God grant us patience!
Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.
There is nothing so bitter that a patient mind cannot find some solace for it.
Patience is the best remedy for every trouble.
For ye have need of patience....
"They are ill discoverers that think there is no land, when they see nothing but sea."
The best way out of a difficulty is through it.
Many things difficult to design prove easy to performance.
A diplomat is a man who remembers a lady's birthday but forgets her age.
When a diplomat says yes he means perhaps; when he says perhaps he means no; when he says no he is no diplomat.
"I have discovered the art of deceiving diplomats. I speak the truth, and they never believe me."
Diplomacy is to do and say The nastiest thing in the nicest way.
Disappointment is the nurse of wisdom.
"The best-laid schemes o' mice an' men, Gang aft a-gley, And leave us nought but grief and pain, For promised joy."
Disappointments are to the soul what a thunder-storm is to the air.
Men would be angels; Angels would be gods.
Now is the Winter of our discontent.
I was born to other things.
Discontent is the first step in the progress of a man or a nation.
Discretion in speech is more than eloquence.
A sound discretion is not so much indicated by never making a mistake as by never repeating it.
Great ability without discretion comes almost invariably to a tragic end.
"Let your own discretion be your tutor; suit the action to the word, the word to the action."
The better part of valour is discretion.
Disease is the retribution of outraged Nature.
Disease is an experience of so-called mortal mind. It is fear made manifest on the body.
Desperate diseases require desperate remedies.
Some remedies are worse than the disease.
"Whatever disgrace we may have deserved, it is almost always in our power to re-establish our character."
No one can disgrace us but ourselves.
Doubt the man who swears to his devotion.
"Women distrust men too much in general, and too little in particular."
What loneliness is more lonely than distrust?
Doctrine is nothing but the skin of truth set up and stuffed.
"How absurd to try to make two men think alike on matters of religion, when I cannot make two timepieces agree!"
"In religion as in politics it so happens that we have less charity for those who believe half our creed, than for diose who deny the whole of it."
"You can and you can't, You will and you won't; You'll be damn'd if you do, You'll be damn'd if you don't."
"""Orthodoxy, my Lord,"" said Bishop Warburton, in a whisper,  -  ""orthodoxy is my doxy,  -  heterodoxy is another man's doxy."""
Do not disturb the sleeping dog.
Every dog is entitled to one bite.
Who loves me will love my dog also.
"You're only a dog, old fellow; a dog, and you've had your day; But never a friend of all my friends has been truer than you alway."
I agree with Agassiz that dogs possess something very like a conscience.
"Oh, the saddest of sights in a world of sin Is a little lost pup with his tail tucked in!"
Fox-terriers are born with about four times as much original sin in them as other dogs.
"The more one comes to know men, the more one comes to admire the dog."
The dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.
The cowardly dog barks more violently than it bites.

"If you're a champion, you have to have it in your heart."
"Human nature, if it healthy, demands excitement; and if it does not obtain its thrilling excitement in the right way, it will seek it in the wrong. God never makes bloodless stoics; He makes no passionless saints."

The world belongs to the energetic.
The real difference between men is energy.
A faint endeavor ends in a sure defeat.
"Flaming enthusiasm, backed up by horse sense and persistence, is the quality that most frequently makes for success."
Success is going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.
"There is a passion for perfection which you rarely see fully developed, but... in successful lives it is never wholly lacking."
"Many of the most successful men I have known have never grown up. They have retained bubbling-over boyishness. They have relished wit, they have indulged in humor. They have not allowed ""dignity"" to depress them into moroseness. Youthfulness of spirit is the twin brother of optimism, and optimism is the stuff of which American business success is fashioned. Resist growing up!"
"If you have the will to win, you have achieved half your success; if you don't, you have achieved half your failure."
"Someone's always saying, ""It's not whether you win or lose,"" but if you feel that way, you're as good as dead."

It is fatal to enter any war without the will to win it.
The measure of an enthusiasm must be taken between interesting events. It is between bites that the lukewarm angler loses heart.

"To burn always with this hard gemlike flame. To maintain this ecstasy, is success in life."
"Every man is enthusiastic at times. One man has enthusiasm for thirty minutes, another man has it for thirty days. But it is the man who has it for thirty years who makes a success in life."
Man never rises to great truths without enthusiasm.
Success is due less to ability than to zeal.
I rate enthusiasm even above professional skill.
"He did it with all his heart, and prospered."
"A strong passion for any object will ensure success, for the desire of the end will point out the means."
Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm.
"What a man accomplishes in a day depends upon the way in which he approaches his tasks. When we accept tough jobs as a challenge to our ability and wade into them with joy and enthusiasm, miracles can happen. When we do our work with a dynamic, conquering spirit, we get things done."
"If you're not happy every morning when you get up, leave for work, or start to work at home-if you're not enthusiastic about doing that, you're not going to be successful."
The method of the enterprising is to plan with audacity and execute with vigor.
Do it big or stay in bed.
Sometimes success is due less to ability than to zeal.
Zeal will do more than knowledge.
"Let a man in a garret burn with enough intensity, and he will set fire to the world."
"Knowledge is power, but enthusiasm pulls the switch."
"Through zeal, knowledge is gotten; through lack of zeal, knowledge is lost."
I prefer the errors of enthusiasm to the indifference of wisdom.
"It is energy, the central element of which is will, that produces the miracles of enthusiasm in all ages. It is the mainspring of what is called force of character and the sustaining power of all great action."
The difference between one man and another is not mere ability ... it is energy.
"You see me in my most virile moment when you see me doing what I do. When I am directing, a special energy comes upon me. ... It is only when I am doing my work that I feel truly alive. It is like having sex."
"Energy, even like the Biblical grain of mustard-seed, will move mountains."
Energy and persistence conquer all things.
Energy will do anything that can be done in this world.
The only thing that keeps a man going is energy. And what is energy but liking life?
"No one grows old by living, only by losing interest in living."
None are so old as those who have outlived enthusiasm.
"Years wrinkle the face, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul."
He fights with spirit as well as with the sword.
It is fatal to enter any war without the will to win it.
Morale is the greatest single factor in successful wars.
The will to conquer is the first condition of victory.
"The aim of military training is not just to prepare men for battle, but to make them long for it."
"Wars may be fought with weapons, but they are won by men. It is the spirit of men who follow and of the man who leads that gains the victory."
"Enthusiasm can only be aroused by two things: first, an ideal which takes the imagination by storm, and sec ond, a definite, intelligible plan for carrying that ideal into practice."
Earnestness and sincereness are synonymous.
"Opposition inflames the enthusiast, never converts him."
"No one keeps up his enthusiasm automatically. Enthusiasm must be nourished with new actions, new aspirations, new efforts, new vision. Compete with yourself; set your teeth and dive into the job of breaking your own record. It is one's own fault if his enthusiasm is gone; he has failed to feed it."
The same reason makes a man a religious enthusiast that makes a man an enthusiast in any other way ... an uncomfortable mind in an uncomfortable body.
"The great composer does not set to work because he is inspired, but becomes inspired because he is working. Beethoven, Wagner, Bach and Mozart settled down day after day to the job in hand with as much regularity as an accountant settles down each day to his figures. They didn't waste time waiting for inspiration."
Enthusiasm is nothing more or less than faith in action.
"Whatever course you have chosen for yourself, it will not be a chore but an adventure if you bring to it a sense of the glory of striving, if your sights are set far above the merely secure and mediocre."
"Vigor is contagious, and whatever makes us either think or feel strongly adds to our power and enlarges our field of action."
Practice being excited.
It is the greatest shot of adrenaline to be doing what you've wanted to do so badly. You almost feel like you could fly without the plane.
Reason alone is insufficient to make us enthusiastic in any matter.
"Nothing is so contagious as enthusiasm; it moves stones, it charms brutes. Enthusiasm is the genius of sincerity and truth accomplishes no victories without it."
Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm.
The world belongs to the Enthusiast who keeps cool.
California is a fine place to live - if you happen to be an orange.

"Fourscore and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."

"Failure is an event, never a person."
It is better to be boldly decisive and risk being wrong than to agonize at length and be right too late.
"I've never met a person, I don't care what his condition, in whom I could not see possibilities. I don't care how much a man may consider himself a failure, I believe in him, for he can change the thing that is wrong in his life anytime he is prepared and ready to do it.

Failure after long perseverance is much grander than never to have a striving good enough to be called a failure.
The sight of a cage is only frightening to the bird that has once been caught.
Your success depends on your ability to dream and follow through on those dreams.

Mother love has been much maligned. An over mothered boy may go through life expecting each new woman to love him the way his mother did. Her love may make any other love seem inadequate. But an unloved boy would be even more likely to idealize love. I don't think it's possible for a mother or father to love a child too much.
"Unconditional love is loving your kids for who they are, not for what they do ... it isn't something you will achieve every minute of every day. But it is the thought we must hold in our hearts every day."

We'd all laugh and laugh . . . then suddenly Grampa's mood would change, and we'd all have to run for our lives. . . . You can't buy memories like that."
"Children begin by loving their parents. After a time they judge them. Rarely, if ever, do they forgive them."
"It is my pleasure that my children are free and happy, and unrestrained by parental tyranny. Love is the chain whereby to bind a child to its parents."
Perfect love sometimes does not come until the first grandchild.
The reason grandparents and grandchildren get along so well is that they have a common enemy.

"Teaching kids to count is fine, but teaching them what counts is best."
It is infinitely more useful for a child to hear a story told by a person than by computer. Because the greatest part of the learning experience lies not in the particular words of the story but in the involvement with the individual reading it.
"The parents exist to teach the child, but also they must learn what the child has to teach them; and the child has a very great deal to teach them."
"Grown men can learn from very little children for the hearts of little children are pure. Therefore, the Great Spirit may show to them many things which older people miss."
"Children have a remarkable talent for not taking the adult world with the kind of respect we are so confident it ought to be given.

They refuse to appreciate the gravity of our monumental concerns, while we forget that if we were to become more like children our concerns might not be so monumental."

Those who love the young best stay young longer.

"Remember, no matter how many candles you blow out this year, there's one gal who will always think of you as young, strong and handsome - your mother."
There's no way to be a perfect mother and a million ways to be a good one.
"God could not be everywhere, therefore he made mothers."
"Parents are often so busy with the physical rearing of children that they miss the glory of parenthood, just as the grandeur of the trees is lost when raking leaves."
The best inheritance a parent can give his children is a few minutes of his time each day.
"If I had known how wonderful it would be to have grandchildren, I'd have had them first."
Few things are more delightful than grandchildren fighting over your lap.
The greatest sweetener of human life is Friendship.
A friend might well be reckoned the masterpiece of nature.
"Of all the things which wisdom provides to make us entirely happy, much the greatest is the possession of friendship."
Friendship is the only cement that will ever hold the world together.

What a great blessing is a friend with a heart so trusty you may safely bury all your secrets in it.
"When a friend is in trouble, don't annoy him by asking if there is anything you can do. Think up something appropriate and do it."

"Friendship improves happiness, and abates misery, by doubling our joy, and dividing our grief."
"It is not what you give your friend, but what you are willing to give him, that determines the quality of your friendship."
A friend is someone who knows all about you and loves you just the same.
"It is not the talking that counts between friends, it is the never needing to say what counts."
True friendship comes when silence between two people is comfortable.
Friendship is a single soul dwelling in two bodies.
To be a good friend remember that we are human magnets: that like attracts like and that as we give we get.
"Treat your friends as you do your pictures, and place them in their best light."

Every man should have a fair-sized cemetery in which to bury the faults of his friends.
"Since there is nothing so well worth having as friends, never lose a chance to make them."

"Life is the first gift, love is the second, and understanding the third."
To have a full stomach and fixed income are no small things .
"For one mother, joy is the quiet pleasure found in gently rubbing shampoo into her young child's hair. For another woman it's taking a long walk alone, while for yet another it's reveling in a much-anticipated vacation."
How can they say my life is not a success? Have I not for more than sixty years gotten enough to eat and escaped being eaten?
"Sunshine is delicious, rain is refreshing, wind braces us up, snow is exhilarating; there is really no such thing as bad weather, only different kinds of good weather."
Only a stomach that rarely feels hungry scorns common things.
My gratitude for good writing is unbounded; I'm grateful for it the way I'm grateful for the ocean.

"You say grace before meals. All right. But I say grace before the concert and the opera, and grace before the play and pantomime, and grace before I open a book, and grace before sketching, painting, swimming, fencing, boxing, walking, playing, dancing and grace before I dip the pen in the ink."
"Thank God for dirty dishes; they have a tale to tell. While other folks go hungry, we're eating pretty well. With home, and health, and happiness, we shouldn't want to fuss; For by this stack of evidence, God's very good to us."
It is strange what a contempt men have for the joys that are offered them freely.
Grateful for the blessing lent of simple tastes and mind content!
"An easy thing, O Power Divine, To thank thee for these gifts of Thine, For summer's sunshine, winter's snow, For hearts that kindle, thoughts that glow; But when shall I attain to this- To thank Thee for the things I miss?"
"People call me an optimist, but I'm really an appreciator ... years ago, I was cured of a badly infected finger with antibiotics when once my doctor could have recommended only a hot water soak or, eventually, surgery.... When I was six years old and had scarlet fever, the first of the miracle drugs, sulfanilamide, saved my life. I'm grateful for computers and photocopiers ... I appreciate where we've come from."
"If only the people who worry about their liabilities would think about the riches they do possess, they would stop worrying. Would you sell both your eyes for a million dollars ... or your two legs ... or your hands ... or your hearing? Add up what you do have, and you'll find that you won't sell them for all the gold in the world. The best things in life are yours, if you can appreciate yourself."
"We can be thankful to a friend for a few acres or a little money; and yet for the freedom and command of the whole earth, and for the great benefits of our being, our life, health, and reason, we look upon ourselves as under no obligation."
Health is ... a blessing that money cannot buy.
"Happiness lies, first of all, in health."
A sound mind in a sound body is a short but full description of a happy state in this world.
Health is the vital principle of bliss.
"If you can't be thankful for what you receive, be thankful for what you escape."
"Even though we can't have all we want, we ought to be thankful we don't get all we deserve."
Happy the man who can count his sufferings.
Happiness is composed of misfortunes avoided.
"Considering the fortune you might have lost, you'll have to admit you're rich already."
"I thank Thee first because I was never robbed before; second, because although they took my purse they did not take my life; third, because although they took my all, it was not much; and fourth because it was I who was robbed, and not I who robbed."
Think of the ills from which you are exempt.
A man should always consider ... how much more unhappy he might be than he is.
"The happiness of any given life is to be measured not by its joys and pleasures, but by the extent to which it has been free from suffering, from positive evil."
Better to suffer than to die.
Better a little fire to warm us than a great one to burn us.
It isn't important to come out on top. What matters is to come out alive.
He who limps still walks.
"I have gout, asthma, and seven other maladies, but am otherwise very well."
"Luckily, I never feel at one time more than half my pains."
Pain is no longer pain when it is past.
We are content to forgo joy when pain is also lost.
"The happiest is he who suffers the least pain; the most miserable, he who enjoys the least pleasure."
"Happiness is not being pained in body, or troubled in mind."
The end of pain we take as happiness.
You can be happy indeed if you have breathing space from pain.
The summit of pleasure is the elimination of all that gives pain.
I seek the utmost pleasure and the least pain.

"He is a man of sense who does not grieve for what he has not, but rejoices in what he has."
"Enjoy the successes that you have, and don't be too hard on yourself when you don't do well. Too many times we beat up on ourselves. Just relax and enjoy it."

Few love what they may have.
The knowledge that something remains yet unenjoyed impairs our enjoyment of the good before us.

It is not customary to love what one has.
"The talent for being happy is appreciating and liking what you have, instead of what you don't have."
"Happy thou art not; for what thou hast not, still thou striv'est to get; and what thou hast, forget'est."

"When we cannot get what we love, we must love what is within our reach."
"Take full account of the excellencies which you possess, and in gratitude remember how you would hanker after them, if you had them not."
A wise man cares not for what he cannot have.
"A man can refrain from wanting what he has not, and cheerfully make the best of a bird in the hand."
Long only for what you have.
"The tulip is, among flowers, what the peacock is among birds. A tulip lacks scent, a peacock has an unpleasant voice. The one takes pride in its garb, the other in its tail."
Slight not what is near though aiming at what is far.
"Greediness of getting more, deprives ... the enjoyment of what it had got."
"There is a mortal breed most full of futility. In contempt of what is at hand, they strain into the future, hunting impossibilities on the wings of ineffectual hopes."

"While you fear missing a meal, you aren't fully aware of the meals you do eat."
To be upset over what you don't have is to waste what you do have.
"If there's no bread, cakes are very good."
"Not what we have, but what we enjoy, constitutes our abundance."
"Not what we have, but what we use, not what we see, but what we choose-these are the things that mar or bless human happiness."
The happiness which is lacking makes one think even the happiness one has unbearable.
We always have enough to be happy if we are enjoying what we do have- and not worrying about what we don't have.
"Welcome everything that comes to you, but do not long for anything else."
"The superiority of the distant over the present is only due to the mass and variety of the pleasures that can be suggested, compared with the poverty of those that can at any time be felt."

"All your youth you want to have your greatness taken for granted; when you find it taken for granted, you are unnerved."
Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things only hoped for.

There is no banquet but some dislike something in it.
"If we get everything that we want, we will soon want nothing that we get."

Only with a new ruler do you realize the value of the old.
I remember those happy days and often wish I could speak into the ears of the dead the gratitude which was due to them in life and so ill-returned.
"You can't appreciate home until you've left it, money till it's spent, your wife till she's joined a woman's club, nor Old Glory till you see it hanging on a broomstick on the shanty of a consul in a foreign town."
Birds sing after a storm; why shouldn't people feel as free to delight in whatever remains to them?
Think of all the beauty still left around you and be happy.
"Oh, my friend, it's not what they take away from you that counts-it's what you do with what you have left."
"God gave you a gift of 86,400 seconds today. Have you used one to say ""thank you""?"

Who does not thank for little will not thank for much.
"The beginning of men's rebellion against God was, and is, the lack of a thankful heart."
"A thankful heart is not only the greatest virtue, but the parent of all other virtues."
Seeds of discouragement will not grow in the thankful heart.
"The private and personal blessings we enjoy-the blessings of immunity, safeguard, liberty and integrity- deserve the thanksgiving of a whole life."
"One of life's gifts is that each of us, no matter how tired and downtrodden, finds reasons for thankfulness."
Joy is the simplest form of gratitude.
He who receives a benefit with gratitude repays the first installment on his debt.
"Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend. Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today, and creates a vision for tomorrow."
Remember that not to be happy is not to be grateful.
Gratitude weighs heavy on us only when we no longer feel it.
"Appreciation is yeast, lifting ordinary to extraordinary."
Gratitude is the memory of the heart.
"One can never pay in gratitude; one can only pay ""in kind"" somewhere else in life."
Silent gratitude isn't much use to anyone.
Happiness is itself a kind of gratitude.
One cannot collect all the beautiful shells on the beach.
A man who accustoms himself to buy superfluities is often in want of necessities.
"What is the proper limit for wealth? It is, first, to have what is necessary; and, second, to have what is enough."
He has enough who is contented with little.
There is a great difference between satisfaction and satiation.
More than enough is too much.
It's a grand thing to be able to take your money in your hand and to think no more of it when it slips away from you than you would a trout that would slip back into the stream.
Let him who has enough wish for nothing more.
Nothing is enough to the man for whom enough is too little.
Sufficiency's enough for men of sense.
You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough.
Enough is as good as a feast.

"Philosophy ... should not pretend to increase our present stock, but make us economists of what we are possessed of."
"The use we make of our fortune determines as to its sufficiency. A little is enough if used wisely, and too much is not enough if expended foolishly."
It is possible to own too much. A man with one watch knows what time it is; a man with two watches is never quite sure.
Happiness is a way station between too much and too little.
To be able to dispense with good things is tantamount to possessing them.
We don't need to increase our goods nearly as much as we need to scale down our wants. Not wanting something is as good as possessing it.
The hardest thing is to take less when you can get more.
"Whoever does not regard what he has as most ample wealth is unhappy, though he is master of the world."
"I have learned to seek my happiness by limiting my desires, rather than in attempting to satisfy them."
"How few are our real wants, and how easy is it to satisfy them! Our imaginary ones are boundless and insatiable."
"Of all the people in the world, those who want the most are those who have the most."
Who covets more is evermore a slave.
"If you desire many things, many things will seem but a few."
The heart is great which shows moderation in the midst of prosperity.
Want is a growing giant whom the coat of Have was never large enough to cover.
"Freedom is not procured by a full enjoyment of what is desired, but by controlling the desire."
How many things there are which I do not want.
"Moderate desires constitute a character fitted to acquire all the good which the world can yield. He who has this character is prepared, in whatever situation he is, therewith to be content and has learned the science of being happy."
"Were a man to order his life by the rules of true reason, a frugal substance joined to a contented mind is for him great riches."
One is never fortunate or as unfortunate as one imagines.
Man needs so little ... yet he begins wanting so much.
"Man never has what he wants, because what he wants is everything."
"If your desires be endless, your cares and fears will be so, too."
We are no longer happy so soon as we wish to be happier.
"He is not rich that possesses much, but he that covets no more; and he is not poor that enjoys little, but he that wants too much."
Independence may be found in comparative as well as in absolute abundance; I mean where a person contracts his desires within the limits of his fortune.
One never hugs one's good luck so affectionately as when listening to the relation of some horrible misfortunes which has overtaken others.
"If you would but exchange places with the other fellow, how much more you could appreciate your own position."
"We should learn, by reflection on the misfortunes of others, that there is nothing singular in those which befall ourselves."
"Double-no, triple-our troubles and we'd still be better off than any other people on earth."
"I wept because I had no shoes, until I saw a man who had no feet."
"When life's problems seem overwhelming, look around and see what other people are coping with. You may consider yourself fortunate."
"If all misfortunes were laid in one common heap whence everyone must take an equal portion, most people would be contented to take their own and depart."
"Not he who has little, but he who wishes more, is poor."
The covetous man is always poor.
"He is not poor that hath not much, but he that craves much."
He is poor who does not feel content.
I have no riches but my thoughts. Yet these are wealth enough for me.
He who curbs his desires will always be rich enough.
There is a gigantic difference between earning a great deal of money and being rich.
That man is richest whose pleasures are the cheapest.
"If you want an accounting of your worth, count your friends."
I've had an exciting life; I married for love and got a little money along with it.
True affluence is not needing anything.
There are many excuses for the person who made the mistake of confounding money and wealth. Like many others they mistook the sign for the thing signified.
Friends are the thermometer by which we may judge the temperature of our fortunes.
"To be satisfied with what one has; that is wealth. As long as one sorely needs a certain additional amount, that man isn't rich."
I have the greatest of all riches: that of not desiring them.
My friends are my estate.
A man is rich in proportion to the things he can afford to let alone.
There are people who have money and people who are rich.
He is rich that is satisfied.
"Nor need we power or splendor, wide hall or lordly dome; the good, the true, the tender-these form the wealth of home."
He is well paid that is well satisfied.
He who is content in his poverty is wonderfully rich.
He who is contented is rich.
A BMW can't take you as far as a diploma.
All fortune belongs to him who has a contented mind.
The greatest wealth is contentment with a little.
No one has yet had the courage to memorialize his wealth on his tombstone. A dollar mark would not look well there.
"So many of us define ourselves by what we have, what we wear, what kind of house we live in, and what kind of car we drive ... if you think of yourself as the woman in the Cartier watch and the Hermes scarf, a house fire will destroy not only your possessions but your self."
The externals are simply so many props; everything we need is within us.
"He is not rich that possesses much, but he that is content with what he has."
"One well-cultivated talent, deepened and enlarged, is worth one hundred shallow faculties."
"If only every man would make proper use of his strength and do his utmost, he need never regret his limited ability."
Anyone is to be pitied who has just sense enough to perceive his deficiencies.
"What strange perversity is it that induces a man to set his heart on doing those things which he has not succeeded in, and makes him slight those in which his achievement has been respectable."
"I may not amount to much, but at least I am unique."
"Happy is the man who can do only one thing: in doing it, he fulfills his destiny."
"The real tragedy of life is not being limited to one talent, but in failing to use that one talent."
Too many people overvalue what they are not and undervalue what they are.
Nothing will content him who is not content with a little.
Contentment is worth more than riches.
"I figure if I have my health, can pay the rent and I have my friends, I call it ""content."""
"Be content with what thou hast received, and smooth thy frowning forehead."
He is poor who does not feel content.
"If thou covetest riches, ask not but for contentment, which is an immense treasure."
Who is content with nothing possesses all things.
"My crown is called content, a crown that seldom kings enjoy."
"It is right to be contented with what we have, never with what we are."
Be content with your lot; one cannot be first in everything.
"Content may dwell in all stations. To be low, but above contempt, may be high enough to be happy."
"He is not rich that possesses much, but he that is content with what he has."
"True contentment... is the power of getting out of any situation all that there is in it. It is arduous, and it is rare."
"Poor and content is rich, and rich enough."
The greatest wealth is contentment with a little.
And be content with such things as ye have.
"Everything has its wonders, even darkness and silence, and I learn, whatever state I may be in, therein to be content."
Try to live the life of the good man who is more than content with what is allocated to him.
The world is full of people looking for spectacular happiness while they snub contentment.
We are never content with our lot.
"Until you make peace with who you are, you'll never be content with what you have."
"True contentment depends not upon what we have; a tub was large enough for Diogenes, but a world was too little for Alexander."
"To be content with little is difficult; to be content with much, impossible."
"Reflect upon your present blessings, of which every man has many; not on your past misfortunes, of which all men have some."
"No longer forward nor behind I look in hope or fear; But, grateful, take the good I find, The best of now and here."
What a wonderful life I've had! I only wish I'd realized it sooner.
"Was it always my nature to take a bad time and block out the good times, until any success became an accident and failure seemed the only truth?"
Most human beings have an almost infinite capacity for taking things for granted.
There are men who are happy without knowing it.
We are all of us richer than we think we are.
"What a miserable thing life is: you're living in clover, only the clover isn't good enough."
"I am convinced, the longer I live, that life and its blessings are not so entirely unjustly distributed as when we are suffering greatly we are inclined to suppose."
Life is hard. Next to what?
"Over a period of time it's been driven home to me that I'm not going to be the most popular writer in the world, so I'm always happy when anything in any way is accepted."
"It made me gladsome to be getting some education, it being like a big window opening."
Too much of a good thing can be wonderful.
"A man with ambition and love for his blessings here on earth is ever so alive. Having been alive, it won't be so hard in the end to lie down and rest."
"In the country of the blind, the one-eyed man is king."
"Be satisfied, and pleased with what thou art, Act cheerfully and well thou allotted part; Enjoy the present hour, be thankful for the past, And neither fear, nor wish, the approaches of the last."
"No one is satisfied with his fortune, or dissatisfied with his intellect."
Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.
"God pardons like a mother, who kisses the offense into everlasting forgetfulness."
"Good, to forgive; Best, to forget."
It is easier to forgive an enemy than a friend.
"His heart was as great as the world, but there was no room in it to hold the memory of a wrong."
Bear and forbear.
"Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us."
"To err is human, to forgive, divine."
"Forgive others often, yourself never."
It is manlike to punish but godlike to forgive.
"Fortune makes him fool, whom she makes her darling."
"It is fortune, not wisdom, that rules man's life."
Fortune truly helps those who are of good judgment.
The bitter dregs of Fortune's cup to drain.
Fortunes made in no time are like shirts made in no time; it's ten to one if they hang long together.
Men are seldom blessed with good fortune and good sense at the same time.
Fortune and Love befriend the bold.
Every man is the architect of his own fortune.
"O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle."
"There is a tide in the affairs of men Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune."
A sleeping fox counts hens in his dreams.
"Frailty, thy name is woman!"
An amiable weakness.
Forty million Frenchmen can't be wrong.
"France, freed from that monster, Bonaparte, must again become the most agreeable country on earth. It would be the second choice of all whose ties of family and fortune give a preference to some other one, and the first choice of all not under those ties."
"Ye sons of France, awake to glory! Hark! Hark! what myriads bid you rise! Your children, wives and grandsires hoary, Behold their tears and hear their cries!"
"France always has plenty men of talent, but it is always deficient in men of action and high character."
The cause of freedom is the cause of God.
Life is not so short but that there is always time enough for courtesy.
A decent boldness ever meets with friends.
"It is not enough to succeed, a friend must fail."
A friend in power is a friend lost.
A friend is one before whom I may think aloud.
Iron sharpeneth man; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.

Every time I paint a portrait I lose a friend.

"Good Americans, when they die, go to Paris."
We had a very successful trip to Russia we got back.
Enjoy life. Think of all the women who passed up dessert on the Titanic.
Everybody should believe in something; I believe I'll have another drink.
I know lots more old drunks than old doctors.
"I'm a one-drink woman, two at the most, three I'm under the table, four I'm under the host."
My doctor said I look like a million dollars - green and wrinkled.
Condoms aren't completely safe. A friend of mine was wearing one . . . and got hit by a bus.
"My doctor gave me six months to live, but when I couldn't pay the bill, he gave me six months more."
"I can't believe that out of a hundred thousand sperm, you were the quickest."
I hope you live to be as old as your jokes.
"My wife is the most wonderful woman in the world, and that's not just my opinion - it's hers."
"she: Before we got married, you told me you were well-off. he: I was, and I didn't know it."
A good marriage would be between a blind wife and a deaf husband.
Why did God make man before he made woman? Because he didn't want any advice on how to do it.
The best way to remember your wife's birthday is to forget it once.
She's too young for Medicare and too old for me to care.

"When all else is lost, the future still remains."
"Tis the sunset of life gives me mystical lore, And coming events cast their shadows before."
I never think of the future. It comes soon enough.
I know of no way of judging the future but by the past.
The present is great with the future
"Trust no Future, howe'er pleasant! Let the dead Past bury its dead!"
Go forth to meet the shadowy Future without fear and with a manly heart.
Take therefore no thought for the morrow; for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
There was the Door to which I found no key; There was the Veil through which I might not see.
There was a wise man in the East whose constant prayer was that he might see today with the eyes of tomorrow.
"I believe the future is only the past again, entered through another gate."
"Till the sun grows cold, And the stars are old, And the leaves of the Judgment Book unfold."
The race is not always to the swift nor the battle to the strong - but that's the way to bet.
"There is but one good throw upon the dice, which is to throw them away."

"A garden is a lovesome thing - God wot! Rose plot, Fringed pool, Fern grot -  The veriest school Of peace; and yet the fool Contends that God is not. -  Not God in gardens! When the sun is cool? Nay, but I have a sign! 'Tis very sure God walks in mine."
"God the first garden made, and the first city Cain."
The Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
One is nearer God's heart in a garden Than anywhere else on earth.
The difference between genius and stupidity is that genius has its limits.
The genius of Einstein leads to Hiroshima.
"Genius, in truth, means little more than the faculty of perceiving in an unhabitual way."
"Genius as such can neither be explained nor treated away; only, at times, its delay and inhibition and its perversion to destructive or self-destructive ends."
"To believe your own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men - that is genius."
Doing easily what others find is difficult is talent; doing what is impossible for talent is genius.

The parting genius is with sighing sent.
Every man of genius is considerably helped by being dead.
"In the republic of mediocrity, genius is dangerous."
We define genius as the capacity for productive reaction against one's training.
Before I was a genius I was a drudge.
In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.
"Genius develops in quiet places, character out in the full current of human life."
Men of genius are the worst possible models for men of talent.
The public is wonderfully tolerant. It forgives everything except genius.
"When a true genius appears in the world you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him."
Talent is that which is in a man's power; genius is that in whose power a man is.
There is a thin line between genius and insanity. I have erased this line.
Improvement makes straight roads; but the crooked roads without improvement are roads of genius.
Geniuses are the luckiest of mortals because what they must do is the same as what they most want to do.
Everyone is a genius at least once a year; a real genius has his original ideas closer together.
"The true genius is a mind of large general powers, accidentally determined to some particular direction."
The mark of genius is an incessant activity of mind. Genius is a spiritual greed.
Genius is an African who dreams up snow.
"Sometimes men come by the name of genius in the same way that certain insects come by the name of centipede - not because they have a hundred feet, but because most people can't count above fourteen."
"Too often we forget that genius ... depends upon the data within its reach, that Archimedes could not have devised Edison's inventions."
There is no great genius without a mixture of madness.
Genius is only great patience.
Genius is one per cent inspiration and ninety-nine per cent perspiration.
"Genius does what it must, and talent does what it can."
"Gift, like genius, I often think only means an infinite capacity for taking pains."
Genius is a promontory jutting out of the infinite.
Three-fifths of him genius and two-fifths sheer fudge.
The lamp of genius burns quicker than the lamp of life.
The poet's scrolls will outlive the monuments of stone. The Genius survives; all else is claimed by death.
A gentleman is man who can disagree without being disagreeable.
The gentleman is a Christian product.
"Once a gentleman, always a gentleman."
Propriety of manners and consideration for others are the two main characteristics of a gentleman.
"To make a fine gentleman, several trades are required, but chiefly a barber."
"Let us put Germany, so to speak, in the saddle! you will see that she can ride."

Act decidedly and take the consequences. No good is ever done by hesitation.
"How lovely to think that no one need wait a moment, we can start now, start slowly changing the world!"
"To know what has to be done, then do it, comprises the whole philosophy of practical life."
"If you want to do something, do it!"
Something must happen!
Putting off an easy thing makes it hard. Putting off a hard thing makes it impossible.
"Delay always breeds danger, and to protract a great design is often to ruin it."
The wise man does at once what the fool does finally.
"In putting off what one has to do, one runs the risk of never being able to do it."
Getting an idea should be like sitting down on a pin; it should make you jump up and do something.
Procrastination is opportunity's assassin.
"To do anything in this world worth doing, we must not stand back shivering and thinking of the cold and danger, but jump in and scramble through as well as we can."
"The man who will not execute his resolutions when they are fresh upon him can have no hope from them afterwards; they will be dissipated, lost and perish in the hurry and scurry of the world, or sunk in the slough of indolence."
"Why always, ""not yet""? Do flowers in spring say, ""not yet""?"
We are very near to greatness: one step and we are safe; can we not take the leap?
The keen spirit seizes the prompt occasion.
"The hour is ripe, and yonder lies the way."
Delay not to seize the hour!
I was seldom able to see an opportunity until it had ceased to be one.
"This one makes a net, this one stands and wishes. Would you like to make a bet which one gets the fishes?"
Inspirations never go in for long engagements; they demand immediate marriage to action.
"If we really want to live, we'd better start at once to try."
The rewards in business go to the man who does something with an idea.
The important thing is somehow to begin.
Eighty percent of success is showing up.
"As long as you can start, you are all right. The juice will come."
The way to get ahead is to start now.
Begin doing what you want to do now.
It is no good hearing an inner voice or getting an inner prompting if you do not immediately act on that inner prompting.
"Even if you're on the right track, you'll get run over if you just sit there."
The first step is the hardest.
The art of writing is the art of applying the seat of the pants to the seat of the chair.
Every beginning is hard.
A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.
"Whenever you take a step forward, you are bound to disturb something."
"If you miss the first buttonhole, you will not succeed in buttoning up your coat."
"If you don't place your foot on the rope, you'll never cross the chasm."
He who is outside the door has already a good part of his journey behind him.
The beginning is half of every action.
The man who removes a mountain begins by carrying away small stones.
Everyone who got where he is had to begin where he was.
"Change your life today. Don't gamble on the future, act now, without delay."
The most important thing about getting somewhere is starting right where we are.
Sometimes we look so intently toward the pinnacle that we stumble over the steps leading to it. Development begins just where you are.
"Few begin with anything like a clear view of what they want to do, and the fortune they seek may come in a very different form from that which they have kept in view."
"The most effective way to do it, is to do it."
Beginnings are apt to be shadowy.
We will not know unless we begin.
"Let us watch well our beginnings, and results will manage themselves."
"You cannot contribute anything to the ideal condition of mind and heart known as Brotherhood, however much you preach, posture, or agree, unless you live it."
The secret of getting ahead is getting started.
"To always be intending to live a new life, but never to find time to set about it; this is as if a man should put off eating and drinking and sleeping from one day and night to another, till he is starved and destroyed."
To choose is also to begin.
"Knowing is not enough, we must apply. Willing is not enough, we must do."
Wisdom is harder to do than it is to know.
Justice is a concept. Muscle is the reality.
No one has a right to sit down and feel hopeless. There's too much work to do.
"Do noble things, do not dream them all day long."
"That is the principal thing: not to remain with the dream, with the intention, with the being in the mood, but always forcibly to convert it into all things."

Don't sit down and wait for the opportunities to come; you have to get up and make them.
The individual activity of one man with backbone will do more than a thousand men with a mere wishbone.
With mere good intentions hell is proverbially paved.
All the beautiful sentiments in the world weigh less than a single lovely action.

Things don't turn up in this world until somebody turns them up.
Act-act in the living present!
Life is essentially a series of events to be lived through rather than intellectual riddles to be played with and solved.
There are risks and costs to a program of action. But they are far less than the long-range risks and costs of comfortable inaction.
What you don't do can be a destructive force.
He that is overcautious will accomplish little.
"Untilled ground, however rich, will bring forth thistles and thorns; so also the mind of man."
Often greater risk is involved in postponement than in making a wrong decision.
The bitterest tears shed over graves are for words left unsaid and deeds left undone.
And all that you are sorry for is what you haven't done.
Can anything be sadder than work unfinished? Yes; work never begun.
The only things you regret are the things you didn't do.
"Above all, try something."
To avoid an occasion for our virtues is a worse degree of failure than to push forward pluckily and make a fall.
Indifference and inaction must always pay a penalty.
Shun idleness. It is a rust that attaches itself to the most brilliant metals.
"I do not believe in a fate that falls on men however they act, but I do believe in a fate that falls on men unless they act."
The real nature of an ethic is that it does not become an ethic unless and until it goes into action.
For it isn't enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isn't enough to believe in it. One must work at it.
"Words are mere bubbles of water, but deeds are drops of gold."
"Ef women want any rights more'n dey got, why don't dey jes' take 'em and not be talkin' about it."
All talk of women's rights is moonshine. Women have every right. They have only to exercise them.
A man of words and not of deeds is like a garden full of weeds.
"Life is worth being lived, but not worth being discussed all the time."
"Action, not words, are the true criterion of the attachment of friends."
Words without actions are the assassins of idealism.
"If you have something to do that is worthwhile doing, don't talk about it ... do it."
"If deeds are wanting, all words appear mere vanity and emptiness."
"Talking is easy, action difficult."
One's feelings waste themselves in words; they ought all to be distilled into action ... which bring results.
"Boast not of what thou would'st have done, but do."
I like to deliver more than I promise instead of the other way around.
"When I talked, no one listened to me. But as soon as I acted I became persuasive, and I no longer find anyone incredulous."
"If you can talk brilliantly about a problem, it can create the consoling illusion that it has been mastered."
Words gain credibility by deed.
Men are alike in their promises. It is only in their deeds that they differ.
An acre of performance is worth a whole world of promise.
Well done is better than well said.
Our chief defect is that we are more given to talking about things than to doing them.
We have too many sounding words and too few actions that correspond with them.
Activity in back of a very small idea will produce more than inactivity and the planning of a genius.
"When it comes to getting things done, we need fewer architects and more bricklayers."
"Get good counsel before you begin; and when you have decided, act promptly."
"Ideas are one thing, and what happens is another."
Thinking about swimming isn't much like actually getting in the water. Actually getting in the water can take your breath away.
"All worthwhile men have good thoughts, good ideas and good intentions, but precious few of them ever translate those into action."
"A thought which does not result in an action is nothing much, and an action which does not proceed from a thought is nothing at all."
To think is easy. To act is difficult. To act as one thinks is the most difficult of all.
"Unless a capacity for thinking be accompanied by a capacity for action, a superior mind exists in torture."
"Contemplation often makes life miserable. We should act more, think less, and stop watching ourselves live."
"What you theoretically know, vividly realize."
We must not waste life in devising means. It is better to plan less and do more.
The best way to prepare for life is to begin to live.
"We are always getting ready to live, but never living."
Action will remove the doubt that theory cannot solve.
It is a common observation that those who dwell continually upon their expectations are apt to become oblivious to the requirements of their actual situation.
He who deliberates fully before taking a step will spend his entire life on one leg.
We don't have enough time to premeditate all our actions.
The opportunity is often lost by deliberating.
To think too long about doing a thing often becomes its undoing.
"Do not wait for ideal circumstances, nor the best opportunities; they will never come."
"Do what you can, with what you have, where you are."
Anything worth doing is worth doing too soon.
"""Now"" is the operative word. Everything you put in your way is just a method of putting off the hour when you could actually be doing your dream."
"Common sense does not ask an impossible chessboard, but takes the one before it and plays the game."
I don't wait for moods. You accomplish nothing if you do that. Your mind must know it has got to get down to earth.
My evil genius Procrastination has whispered me to tarry 'til a more convenient season.
"I realize that if I wait until I am no longer afraid to act, write, speak, be, I'll be sending messages on a ouija board, cryptic complaints from the other side."
He who postpones the hour of living is like the rustic who waits for the river to run out before he crosses.
"Being unready and ill-equipped is what you have to expect in life. It is the universal predicament. It is your lot as a human being to lack what it takes. Circumstances are seldom right. You never have the capacities, the strength, the wisdom, the virtue you ought to have. You must always do with less than you need in a situation vastly different from what you would have chosen."
He who hesitates is last.
Conditions are never just right. People who delay action until all factors are favorable do nothing.
"You decide you'll wait for your pitch. Then as the ball starts toward the plate, you think about your stance. And then you think about your swing. And then you realize that the ball that went past you for a strike was your pitch."
"So what do we do? Anything. Something. So long as we just don't sit there. If we screw it up, start over. Try something else. If we wait until we've satisfied all the uncertainties, it may be too late."
Nothing at all will be attempted if all possible objections must first be overcome.
"No age or time of life, no position or circumstance, has a monopoly on success. Any age is the right age to start doing!"
Everyone must row with the oars he has.
"The question for each man is not what he would do if he had the means, time, influence and educational advantages, but what he will do with the things he has."
"How many opportunities come along? If you wait for the right one, that's wrong, because it may never be right, and what have you got to lose? Even if it's a disaster, you've tried, you've learned something, you've had an adventure. And that doesn't mean you can't do it again."
"And now, Lord, what wait I for?"
We should be taught not to wait for inspiration to start a thing. Action always generates inspiration. Inspiration seldom generates action.
If you wait for inspiration you'll be standing on the corner after the parade is a mile down the street.
The best place to succeed is where you are with what you have.
One of these days is none of these days.
Who waits until the wind shall silent keep Will never find the ready hour to sow.
Begin somewhere; you cannot build a reputation on what you intend to do.
"If you wait for the perfect moment when all is safe and assured, it may never arrive. Mountains will not be climbed, races won, or lasting happiness achieved."
There is nothing to be gained by waiting for a better situation. You see where you are and you do what you can with that.
"It is in your act that you exist, not in your body. Your act is yourself, and there is no other you."
The things people discard tell more about them than the things they keep.
The test of any man lies in action.
"Every action we take, everything we do, is either a victory or defeat in the struggle to become what we want to be."
"It's where we go, and what we do when we get there, that tells us who we are."
By his deeds we know a man.
A human being has no discernible character until he acts.
"What we make is more important than what we are, particularly if making is our profession."
To do is to be.
You can't build a reputation on what you intend to do.
To be is to do.
The way to do is to be.
"The ordinary man is involved in action, the hero acts. An immense difference."
"We judge ourselves by what we feel capable of doing, while others judge us by what we have already done."
"Our deeds determine us, as much as we determine our deeds."
"The emotions are not always subject to reason ... but they are always subject to action. When thoughts do not neutralize an undesirable emotion, action will."
"Silences have a climax, when you have got to speak."
He who desires but acts not breeds pestilence.
"When I am idle and shiftless, my affairs become confused; when I work, I get results ... not great results, but enough to encourage me."
"To be busy with material affairs is the best preservative against reflection, fears, doubts ... all these things which stand in the way of achievement. I suppose a fellow proposing to cut his throat would experience a sort of relief while occupied in stropping his razor carefully."
"Acting can work a peculiar magic on the actor ... it can cure you (at least for the length of a performance) of a whole variety of ailments. Migraine headaches, miserable colds or toothaches will suddenly disappear as you're up there going through your paces."
"It is only when I dally with what I am about, look back and aside instead of keeping my eyes straight forward, that I feel these cold sinkings of the heart. But the first broadside puts all to rights."
Action is the antidote to despair.
"Action is the only reality; not only reality, but morality as well."
Performance releases pressure.
Wishing does not make a poor man rich.
You can't get rich sitting on the bench.
Action makes more fortunes than caution.
"For purposes of action, nothing is more useful than narrowness of thought combined with energy of will."
"How, then, find the courage for action?... By accepting the human condition more simply and candidly, by dreading troubles less, calculating less, hoping more."
Necessity of action takes away the fear of the act.
Commitment leads to action. Action brings your dream closer.
One starts an action simply because one must do something.
"We couldn't possibly know where it would lead, but we knew it had to be done."
It is more blessed to give than to receive.
You give but little when you give of your possessions. It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.
"I make presents to the mother, but think of the daughter."
"Give an inch, he'll take an ell."
He gives twice who gives quickly.
"Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?"
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
"I fear the Greeks, even when they bring gifts."
"Behold, I do not give lectures or a little charity, When I give I give myself."
"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory."
The paths of glory lead but to the grave.
Mine eyes have seen the coming of the glory of the Lord.
O how quickly passes away the glory of the earth.
One crowded hour of glorious life Is worth an age without a name.
God helps those who help themselves.
"Man proposes, and God disposes."
God's in His Heaven -  All's right with the world!
Fear that man who fears not God.
"Nearer, my God, to Thee - Nearer to Thee -  E'en though it be a cross That raiseth me; Still all my song shall be Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee!"
"I took a day to search for God, And found Him not. But as I trod By rocky ledge, through woods untamed, Just where one scarlet lily flamed, I saw His foot print in the sod."
"A picket frozen on duty  -  A mother starved for her brood -  Socrates drinking the hemlock, And Jesus on the rood; And millions who, humble and nameless, The straight, hard pathway trod  -  Some call it Consecration, And others call it God."
God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things that are mighty.
God moves in a mysterious way His wonders to perform; He plants his footsteps in the sea And rides upon the storm.
"God is incorporeal, divine, supreme, infinite Mind, Spirit, Soul, Principle, life, Truth, Love."
An honest God is the noblest work of man.
"""We trust, Sir, that God is on our side."" ""It is more important to know that we are on God's side."""
"A mighty fortress is our God, A bulwark never failing, Our helper he amid the flood Of mortal ills prevailing."
Everyone is in a small way the image of God.
"What is it: is man only a blunder of God, or God only a blunder of man?"
A God-intoxicated man.
"He mounts the storm, and walks upon the wind."
The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth his handiwork.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; he leadeth me beside the still warm waters.
"God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble."
There is no respect of persons with God.
"If God be for us, who can be against us?"
The divine essence itself is love and wisdom.
"God, the Great Giver, can open the whole universe to our gaze in the narrow space of a single lane."
"Rock of Ages, cleft for me, Let me hide myself in thee."
God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb.
"If there were no God, it would be necessary to invent him."
"Give way to the Better if way to the Better there be, It exacts a full look at the Worst."
The significance of a man is not in what he attains but rather in what he longs to attain.
"Once you say you're going to settle for second, that's what happens to you in life, I find."
A successful individual typically sets his next goal somewhat but not too much above his last achievement. In this way he steadily raises his level of aspiration.
The most absurd and reckless aspirations have sometimes led to extraordinary success.
All rising to great places is by a winding stair.
The only thing to know is how to use your neuroses.
"Every ceiling, when reached, becomes a floor, upon which one walks as a matter of course and prescriptive right."
We can always redeem the man who aspires and strives.
The world stands aside to let anyone pass who knows where he is going.
"I have learned to have very modest goals for society and myself, things like clean air, green grass, children with bright eyes, not being pushed around, useful work that suits one's abilities, plain tasty food, and occasional satisfying nookie."
"If you would hit the mark, you must aim a little above it: Every arrow that flies feels the attraction of earth."
"Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a heaven for?"
"Before we set our hearts too much upon anything, let us examine how happy they are, who already possess it."
Ours is a world where people don't know what they want and are willing to go through hell to get it.
"Accept the place the divine providence has found for you, the society of your contemporaries, the connection of events."
Those who aim at great deeds must also suffer greatly.
It is a mistake to look too far ahead. Only one link in the chain of destiny can be handled at a time.
"Do not wish to be anything but what you are, and try to be that perfectly."
"This one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark!"
"Winning isn't everything, but wanting to win is."
It is no longer clear which way is up even if one wants to rise.
Ambition is pitiless. Any merit that it cannot use it finds despicable.
Every man is said to have his peculiar ambition.
Well is it known that ambition can creep as well as soar.
"Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir men's blood . . . Make big plans, aim high in hope and work."
An aim in life is the only fortune worth finding.
You have to have a dream so you can get up in the morning.
"What an immense power over the life is the power of possessing distinct aims. The voice, the dress, the look, the very motions of a person, define and alter when he or she begins to live for a reason."
"If I had one wish for my children, it would be that each of them would reach for goals that have meaning for them as individuals."
The tragedy of life doesn't lie in not reaching your goal. The tragedy lies in having no goal to reach.
Purpose is what gives life a meaning.
Nothing contributes so much to tranquilize the mind as a steady purpose-a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye.
"The poor man is not he who is without a cent, but he who is without a dream."
"He is conscious of touching the highest pinnacle of fulfillment... when he is consumed in the service of an idea, in the conquest of the goal pursued."
He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.
The great and glorious masterpiece of man is to know how to live to purpose.
"Great minds have purposes, others have wishes."
"Unless you give yourself to some great cause, you haven't even begun to live."
"If we could only give, just once, the same amount of reflection to what we want to get out of life that we give to the question of what to do with a two weeks' vacation, we would be startled at our false standards and the aimless procession of our busy days."
"Be a life long or short, its completeness depends on what it was lived for."
"To live means to have ... a mission to fulfill-and in the measure in which we avoid setting our life to something, we make it empty."
"To seek one's goals and to drive toward it, steeling one's heart, is most uplifting!"
The true worth of a man is to be measured by the objects he pursues.
A useless life is an early death.
"My father used to play with my brother and me in the yard. Mother would come out and say, ""You're tearing up the grass."" ""We're not raising grass,"" Dad would reply. ""We're raising boys."""
"Without a purpose, nothing should be done."
To grow and know what one is growing towards-that is the source of all strength and confidence in life.
"Our plans miscarry because they have no aim. When a man does not know what harbor he is making for, no wind is the right wind."
"Every true man, sir, who is a little above the level of the beasts and plants, lives so as to give a meaning and a value to his own life."
"Men cannot for long live hopefully unless they are embarked upon some great unifying enterprise, one for which they may pledge their lives, their fortunes and their honor."
"No pleasure philosophy, no sensuality, no place nor power, no material success can for a moment give such inner satisfaction as the sense of living for good purpose."
"Many are stubborn in pursuit of the path they have chosen, few in pursuit of the goal."
There is one thing which gives radiance to everything. It is the idea of something around the corner.
Lack of something to feel important about is almost the greatest tragedy a man may have.
"There are three ingredients in the good life: learning, earning and yearning."
"If you cry ""Forward,"" you must make plain in what direction to go."
"Men, like nails, lose their usefulness when they lose direction and begin to bend."
"A novelist must know what his last chapter is going to say and one way or another work toward that last chapter. ... To me it is utterly basic, yet it seems like it's a great secret."
Obstacles are those frightful things you see when you take your eyes off the goal.
You must have long-range goals to keep you from being frustrated by short-range failures.
The world stands aside to let anyone pass who knows where he is going.
"This is true joy of life-the being used for a purpose that is recognized by yourself as a right one, instead of being a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances, complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy."
"Not only must we be good, but we must also be good for something."
"It is when things go hardest, when life becomes most trying, that there is greatest need for having a fixed goal. When few comforts come from without, it is all the more necessary to have a fount to draw on from within."
In everything one must consider the end.
A straight path never leads anywhere except to the objective.
There's some end at last for the man who follows a path; mere rambling is interminable.
Having a goal is a state of happiness.
"The American people can have anything they want; the trouble is, they don't know what they want."
Life has a meaning only if one barters it day by day for something other than itself.
"To have a reason to get up in the morning, it is necessary to possess a guiding principle. A belief of some kind. A bumper sticker, if you will."
"An aspiration is a joy forever, a possession as solid as a landed estate, a fortune which we can never exhaust and which gives us year by year a revenue of pleasurable activity."
The soul that has no established aim loses itself.
Life has a value only when it has something valuable as its object.
He turns not back who is bound to a star.
"He might never really do what he said, but at least he had it in mind. He had somewhere to go."
The great and glorious masterpiece of man is how to live with a purpose.
"What most counts is not to live, but to live aright."
Choosing a goal and sticking to it changes everything.
No wind serves him who addresses his voyage to no certain port.
"Laboring toward distant aims sets the mind in a higher key, and puts us at our best."
Everything's in the mind. That's where it all starts. Knowing what you want is the first step toward getting it.
Set short term goals and you'll win games. Set long term goals and you'll win championships!
"We act as though comfort and luxury were the chief requirements of life, when all that we need to make us really happy is something to be enthusiastic about."
Unhappiness is in not knowing what we want and killing ourselves to get it.
Having a dream isn't stupid. ... It's not having a dream that's stupid.
Happiness is the overcoming of not unknown obstacles toward a known goal.
To have no set purpose in one's life is the harlotry of the will.
There is no happiness except in the realization that we have accomplished something.
Strong lives are motivated by dynamic purposes.
One of the sources of pride in being a human being is the ability to bear present frustrations in the interests of longer purposes.
Only he who can see the invisible can do the impossible.
"If you don't know where you are going, how can you expect to get there?"
The only people who attain power are those who crave for it.
"Destiny is not a matter of chance, it is a matter of choice; it is not a thing to be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved."
"In this life we get only those things for which we hunt, for which we strive, and for which we are willing to sacrifice."
You seldom get what you go after unless you know in advance what you want.
"Where no plan is laid, where the disposal of time is surrendered merely to the chance of incident, chaos will soon reign."
A life that hasn't a definite plan is likely to become driftwood.
Only he who keeps his eye fixed on the far horizon will find his right road.
"Fortunate is the person who has developed the self-control to steer a straight course toward his objective in life, without being swayed from his purpose by either commendation or condemnation."
Nothing is more terrible than activity without insight.
"If we would only give, just once, the same amount of reflection to what we want to get out of life that we give to the question of what to do with a two weeks' vacation, we would be startled at our false standards and the aimless procession of our busy days."
The purpose of life is a life of purpose.
Aim at nothing and you'll succeed.
The purpose of life is life.
Goals are dreams with deadlines.
"So long as I believe I have to do certain things, I will just go right ahead. That's how I run my life."
A schedule defends from chaos and whim. It is a net for catching days. It is a scaffolding on which a worker can stand and labor with both hands at sections of time.
"You decide what it is you want to accomplish and then you lay out your plans to get there, and then you just do it. It's pretty straightforward."
What does so-called success or failure matter if only you have succeeded in doing the thing you set out to do. The doing is all that really counts.
"Get out of the blocks, run your race, stay relaxed. If you run your race, you'll win. Channel your energy. Focus."
Know what you want to do-then do it. Make straight for your goal and go undefeated in spirit to the end.
"There is a place in God's sun for the youth ""farthest down"" who has the vision, the determination, and the courage to reach it."
Every man is said to have his peculiar ambition.
"We all live with the objective of being happy; our lives are all different, and yet the same."
Follow your bliss. Find where it is and don't be afraid to follow it.
You can't assume the responsibility for everything you do-or don't do.
"There were angry men confronting me and I caught the flashing of defiant eyes, but above me and within me, there was a spirit stronger than them all."
"A woman finds the natural lay of the land almost unconsciously; and not feeling it incumbent on her to be guide and philosopher to any successor, she takes little pains to mark the route by which she is making her ascent."
"No matter what the competition is, I try to find a goal that day and better that goal."
It doesn't matter what anybody thinks of what I do. The clock doesn't lie.
You can have your titular recognition. I'll take money and power.
"Normal is not something to aspire to, it's something to get away from."
I'm always making a comeback but nobody ever tells me where I've been.
My passions were all gathered together like fingers that made a fist. Drive is considered aggression today; I knew it then as purpose.
"In the multitude of middle-aged men who go about their vocations in a daily course determined for them much in the same way as they tie their cravats, there is always a good number who once meant to shape their own deeds and alter the world a little."
"Remember if people talk behind your back, it only means you're two steps ahead!"
It's a sign of your own worth sometimes if you are hated by the right people.
For me it's the challenge-the challenge to try to beat myself or do better than I did in the past. I try to keep in mind not what I have accomplished but what I have to try to accomplish in the future.
There's a very fine line between a groove and a rut; a fine line between eccentrics and people who are just plain nuts.
Promises that you make to yourself are often like the Japanese plum tree-they bear no fruit.
"I am not sending messages with my feet. All I ever wanted was not to come up empty. I did it for the dough, and the old applause."
"First say to yourself what you would be, and then do what you have to do."
"I can honestly say that I was never affected by the question of the success of an undertaking. If I felt it was the right thing to do, I was for it regardless of the possible outcome."
"What exactly is success? For me it is to be found not in applause, but in the satisfaction of feeling that one is realizing one's ideal."
"We can do whatever we wish to do provided our wish is strong enough. ... What do you want most to do? That's what I have to keep asking myself, in the face of difficulties."
"To be what we are, and to become what we are capable of becoming, is the only end of life."
"You have to define success in your own way. What maintains your dignity and integrity and what is your life's plan, where do you want to put your efforts. I could be richer and more famous, but I would have to give up things that are of infinitely more value."
You cannot do good work if you take your mind off the work to see how the community is taking it.
"When the shriveled skin of the ordinary is stuffed out with meaning, it satisfies the senses amazingly."
"Our victory is sure to come, and I can endure anything but recreancy to principle."
"If you just set out to be liked, you would be prepared to compromise on anything at any time, and you would achieve nothing."
"Concentrate on finding your goal, then concentrate on reaching it."
Enthusiasm for one's goal lessens the disagreeableness of working toward it.
I'm not going to let my life revolve around losing weight. I have other things to do.
"The streams which would otherwise diverge to fertilize a thousand meadows, must be directed into one deep narrow channel before they can turn a mill."
He who wants to do everything will never do anything.
"As you emphasize your life, you must localize and define it... you cannot do everything."
"There are people who want to be everywhere at once, and they get nowhere."
Leader and followers are both following the invisible leader-the common purpose.
"A windmill is eternally at work to accomplish one end, although it shifts with every variation of the weathercock, and assumes ten different positions in a day."
People can have many different kinds of pleasure. The real one is that for which they will forsake the others.
"Nations, like individuals, have to limit their objectives or take the consequences."
"One of the most important factors, not only in military matters but in life as a whole, is ... the ability to direct one's whole energies towards the fulfillment of a particular task."
It is in self-limitation that a master first shows himself.
"One cannot manage too many affairs: like pumpkins in the water, one pops up while you try to hold down the other."
One principle reason why men are so often useless is that they ... divide and shift their attention among a multitude of objects and pursuits.
I can tell you how to get what you want: You've just got to keep a thing in view and go for it and never let your eyes wander to right or left or up or down. And looking back is fatal.
He who begins many things finishes but few.
Who begins too much accomplishes little.
Never try to catch two frogs with one hand.
"If you run after two hares, you will catch neither."
The greyhound that starts many hares kills none.
A bull does not enjoy fame in two herds.
"The man who seeks one thing in life, and but one May hope to achieve it before life be done. But he who seeks all things wherever he goes Only reaps from the hopes which around him he sows A harvest of barren regrets."
"Those who attain any excellence commonly spend life in one pursuit; for excellence is not often granted upon easier terms. -Samuel Johnson No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other."
"He who wishes to fulfill his mission in the world must be a man of one idea, one great overmastering purpose, overshadowing all his aims, and guiding and controlling his entire life."
"Firmness of purpose is one of the most necessary sinews of character and one of the best instruments of success. Without it, genius wastes its efforts in a maze of inconsistencies."
"A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways.... A determinate purpose in life, and a steady adhesion to it through all disadvantages, are indispensable conditions of success."
"If you would be Pope, you must think of nothing else."
"One should want only one thing and want it constantly. Then one is sure of getting it. But I desire everything, and consequently get nothing."
"I care not what your education is, elaborate or nothing, what your mental calibre is, great or small, that man who concentrates all his energies of body, mind and soul in one direction is a tremendous man."
He who hunts two hares leaves one and loses the other.
He who serves two masters has to lie to one.
All animals except man know that the ultimate of life is to enjoy it.
What does so-called success or failure matter if only you have succeeded in doing the thing you set out to do. The doing is all that really counts.
"Catching something is purely a byproduct of our fishing. It is the act of fishing that wipes away all grief, lightens all worry, dissolves all fear and anxiety."
"Let us live, while we are alive!"
"Life is an end in itself, and the only question as to whether it is worth living is whether you have had enough of it."
I take it as a prime cause of the present confusion of society that it is too sickly and too doubtful to use pleasure as a test of value.
There is no cure for birth and death save to enjoy the interval.
Life is about enjoying yourself and having a good time.
All men seek one goal: success or happiness.
"The goal of all civilization, all religious thought, and all that sort of thing is simply to have a good time. But man gets so solemn over the process that he forgets the end."
The business of life is to enjoy oneself; everything else is a mockery.
The true object of human life is play.
"Use your health, even to the point of wearing it out. That is what it is for. Spend all you have before you die; do not outlive yourself."
"Pleasure is the object, duty and the goal of all rational creatures."
Pleasure is the only thing to live for. Nothing ages like happiness.
I finally figured out the only reason to be alive is to enjoy it.
Life exists for the love of music or beautiful things.
There is only one meaning of life: the act of living itself.
The main obligation is to amuse yourself.
"From his cradle to the grave, a man never does a single thing which has any first and foremost object save one-to secure peace of mind, spiritual comfort, for himself."
"I take it that what all men are really after is some form of, perhaps only some formula of, peace."
There is no such thing as expecting too much.
Your goal should be out of reach but not out of sight.
"Why should I deem myself to be a chisel, when I could be the artist?"
"I've always had such high expectations for myself. I'm aware of them, but I can't relax them."
"I want to be great, or nothing. I won't be a commonplace dauber, so I don't intend to try any more."
"We're half the people, we should be half the Congress."
I think the key is for women not to set any limits.
It's expectation that differentiates you from the dead.
The state of the world today demands that women become less modest and dream/plan/act/risk on a larger scale.
"Aim at the sun, and you may not reach it; but your arrow will fly far higher than if aimed at an object on a level with yourself."
"When one paints an ideal, one does not need to limit one's imagination."
"If you would hit the mark, you must aim a little above it; every arrow that flies feels the attraction of earth."
People don't pay much attention to you when you are second best. I wanted to see what it felt like to be number one.
"Nearly every glamorous, wealthy, successful career woman you might envy now started out as some kind of schlepp."
The fact that I was a girl never damaged my ambitions to be a pope or an emperor.
"In the long run men hit only what they aim at. Therefore, though they should fall immediately, they had better aim at something high."
Each time I leaped I seemed to touch the sky and when I regained earth it seemed to be mine alone.
"The tragedy of life doesn't lie in not reaching your goal. The tragedy lies in having no goal to reach. It isn't a calamity to die with dreams unfulfilled, but it is a calamity not to dream. It is not disgrace to reach the stars, but it is a disgrace to have no stars to reach for. Not failure, but low aim, is a sin."
I have an almost complete disregard of precedent and a faith in the possibility of something better. It irritates me to be told how things always have been done. ... I defy the tyranny of precedent. I cannot afford the luxury of a closed mind. I go for anything new that might improve the past.
It's not enough to just swing at the ball. You've got to loosen your girdle and really let it fly.
"I am comforted by life's stability, by earth's unchangeableness. What has seemed new and frightening assumes its place in the unfolding of knowledge."
"Someday, someone will follow in my footsteps and preside over the White House as the President's spouse. And I wish him well."
The most absurd and reckless aspirations have sometimes led to extraordinary success.
"When you reach for the stars, you may not quite get one, but you won't come up with a handful of mud, either."
I might have been born in a hovel but I am determined to travel with the wind and the stars.
The brain is wider than the sky.
My motto: sans limites.
A lot of young girls have looked to their career paths and have said they'd like to be chief. There's been a change in the limits people see.
"[My father] said, Don't grow up to be a woman, and what he meant by that was, a housewife ... without any interests."
"Our being is subject to all the chances of life. There are so many things we are capable of, that we could be or do. The potentialities are so great that we never, any of us, are more than one-fourth fulfilled."
What else are we gonna live by if not dreams? We need to believe in something. What would really drive us crazy is to believe this reality we run into every day is all there is. If I don't believe that there's a happy ending out there-that will-you-marry-me in the sky-I can't keep working today.
People think that at the top there isn't much room. They tend to think of it as an Everest. My message is that there is tons of room at the top.
I am always more interested in what I am about to do than in what I have already done.
"We have believed-and we do believe now-that freedom is indivisible, that peace is indivisible, that economic prosperity is indivisible."
"I always ask the question, ""Is this what I want in my life?"""
Tell them that as soon as I can walk I'm going to fly!
He who demands little gets it.
"Unless in one thing or another we are straining toward perfection, we have forfeited our manhood."
It is necessary to try to surpass one's self always; this occupation ought to last as long as life.
I was born to be a remarkable woman; it matters little in what way or how. ... I shall be famous or I will die.
I never intended to become a run-of-the-mill person.
There is only one real sin and that is to persuade oneself that the second best is anything but second best.
"Too low they build, who build beneath the stars."
I have the same goal I've had ever since I was a little girl. I want to rule the world.
Your world is as big as you make it.
"Whatever course you have chosen for yourself, it will not be a chore but an adventure if you bring to it a sense of the glory of striving, if your sights are set far above the merely secure and mediocre."
"Once you say you're going to settle for second, that's what happens to you."
Aim at heaven and you get earth thrown in; aim at earth and you get neither.
"I truly believe that before I retire from public office, I'll be voting for a woman for president."
"We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars."
If I smashed the traditions it was because I knew no traditions.
"Aim at perfection in everything, though in most things it is unattainable. However they who aim at it, and persevere, will come much nearer to it than those whose laziness and despondency make them give it up as unattainable."
"One may miss the mark by aiming too high, as too low."
"Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss it, you will land among the stars."
We aim above the mark to hit the mark. Every act hath some falsehood or exaggeration in it.
Life is a petty thing unless it is moved by the indomitable urge to extend its boundaries.
"Far away in the sunshine are my highest inspirations. I many not reach them, but I can look up and see the beauty, believe in them and try to follow where they lead."
A man's worth is no greater than the worth of his ambitions.
"Not failure, but low aim, is crime."
"On the human chessboard, all moves are possible."
"Great is the road I climb, but... the garland offered by an easier effort is not worth the gathering."
I never took a position we were going to be a good ball club. I took the position we were going to be a winning ball club.
"Man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a heaven for?"
"Before you begin a thing, remind yourself that difficulties and delays quite impossible to foresee are ahead. ... You can only see one thing clearly and that is your goal. Form a mental vision of that and cling to it through thick and thin."
"You have to erect a fence and say, ""Okay, scale this."""
You can change your beliefs so they empower your dreams and desires. Create a strong belief in yourself and what you want.
Man can only receive what he sees himself receiving.
A person can grow only as much as his horizon allows.
"You must learn day by day, year by year, to broaden your horizon. The more things you love, the more you are interested in, the more you enjoy, the more you are indignant about, the more you have left when anything happens."
"Enjoyment is not a goal, it is a feeling that accompanies important ongoing activity."
"What our deepest self craves is not mere enjoyment, but some supreme purpose that will enlist all our powers and give unity and direction to our life."
"The very first condition of lasting happiness is that a life should be full of purpose, aiming at something outside self."
The only true happiness comes from squandering ourselves for a purpose.
There is more to life than just existing and having a pleasant time.
Happiness is not the end of life; character is.
"Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness. It is not attained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a worthy purpose."
A good goal is like a strenuous exercise-it makes you stretch.
It's weak and despicable to go on wanting things and not trying to get them.
Growth is not concerned with itself.
The self-confidence one builds from achieving difficult things and accomplishing goals is the most beautiful thing of all.
"If ambition doesn't hurt you, you haven't got it."
"We need to restore the full meaning of that old word, duty. It is the other side of rights."
"This is true joy of life-being used for a purpose that is recognized by yourself as a mighty one ... instead of being a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances, complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy."
That is happiness: to be dissolved into something completely great.
I looked on child rearing not only as a work of love and duty but as a profession that was fully as interesting and challenging as any honorable profession in the world and one that demanded the best I could bring to it.
Human happiness and moral duty are inseparably connected.
"The measure of a life, after all, is not its duration, but its donation."
"When we ... devote ourselves to the strict and unsparing performance of duty, ihen happiness comes of itself."
"Duties are what make life most worth living. Lacking them, you are not necessary to anyone."
"Seek happiness for its own sake, and you will not find it; seek for duty, and happiness will follow, as the shadow comes with the sunshine."
"True happiness ... is not attained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a worthy purpose."
The only true happiness comes from squandering ourselves for a purpose.
"True happiness, we are told, consists in getting out of one's self, but the point is not only to get out; you must stay out, and to stay out, you must have some absorbing errand."
Happiness is the natural flower of duty.
The happiest excitement in life is to be convinced that one is fighting for all one is worth on behalf of some clearly seen and deeply felt good.
The secret of living is to find ... the pivot of a concept on which you can make your stand.
The only ones among you who will be really happy are those who will have sought and found how to serve.
"He who never sacrificed a present to a future good, or a personal to a general one, can speak of happiness only as the blind speak of color."
There is no happiness except in the realization that we have accomplished something.
"The full-grown modern human being ... is conscious of touching the highest pinnacle of fulfillment... when he is consumed in the service of an idea, in the conquest of the goal pursued."
"Happiness is essentially a state of going somewhere, wholeheartedly, one-directionally, without regret or reservation."
A man's happiness: to do the things proper to man.
Happy the man who knows his duties!
I believe half the unhappiness in life comes from people being afraid to go straight at things.
Happiness is the overcoming of not unknown obstacles toward a known goal.
"Give a man health and a course to steer, and he'll never stop to trouble about whether he's happy or not."
Having a goal is a state of happiness.
Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort.
"Without duty, life is soft and boneless."
Never mind your happiness; do your duty.
"I probably hold the distinction of being one movie star who, by all laws of logic, should never have made it. At each stage of my career, I lacked the experience."
The man who succeeds above his fellows is the one who early in life discerns his object and toward that object habitually directs his powers. Even genius itself is but fine observation strengthened by fixity of purpose.
"If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours."
"A determinate purpose of life, and steady adhesion to it through all disadvantages, are indispensable conditions of success."
The secret of success is constancy to purpose.
"The man who fails because he aims astray, or because he does not aim at all, is to be found everywhere."
"Life has ... taught me not to expect success to be the inevitable result of my endeavors. She taught me to seek sustenance from the endeavor itself, but to leave the result to God."
"The object of war is not to die for your country, but to make the other bastard die for his."
The object of war is to survive it.
"If we want a free and peaceful world, if we want to make the deserts bloom and man grow to greater dignity as a human being-we can do it."
"The most comprehensive formulation of therapeutic goals is the striving for wholeheartedness: to be without pretense, to be emotionally sincere, to be able to put the whole of oneself into one's feelings, one's work, one's beliefs."
"I think the purpose of life is to be useful, to be responsible, to be honorable, to be compassionate. It is, after all, to matter: to count, to stand for something, to have made some difference that you lived at all."
"Only when men are connected to large, universal goals are they really happy-and one result of their happiness is a rush of creative activity."
"The great business of life is to be, to do, to do without, and to depart."
The proper function of man is to live-not to exist.
Life's objective is life itself.
I seek the utmost pleasure and the least pain.
"There are two things to aim at in life: first, to get what you want, and after that to enjoy it. Only the wisest of mankind achieve the second."
I am searching for that which every man seeks-peace and rest.
"Reach high, for stars lie hidden in your soul. Dream deep, for every dream precedes the goal."
Never undertake anything for which you wouldn't have the courage to ask the blessings of heaven.
The one thing worth living for is to keep one's soul pure.

I believe in the incomprehensibility of God.

"Habituation is a falling asleep or fatiguing of the sense of time, which explains why young years pass slowly, while later life flings itself faster and faster upon its course."
The gnarled fidelity of an old habit.
"Habit is the enormous flywheel of society, its most precious conservative agent. There is no more miserable human being than one in whom nothing is habitual but indecision. Full half the time of such a man goes to the deciding, or regretting, of matters which ought to be so ingrained in him as practically not to exist for his consciousness at all."
"Chaos often breeds life, when order breeds habit."

Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth.
As well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb.

And there is no man who is able to prevent this."

We all live with the objective of being happy; our lives are all different and yet the same.
"The world is so full of a number of things, I'm sure we should all be as happy as kings."

"The U.S. Constitution doesn't guarantee happiness, only the pursuit of it. Your have to catch up with it yourself."

I'm even feeling more and more at peace with myself."" If there's something else to happiness, let me know. I'm ambitious for that, too."
Learn how to feel joy.
"Someone once asked me what I regarded as the three most important requirements for happiness. My answer was: ""A feeling that you have been honest with yourself and those around you; a feeling that you have done the best you could both in your personal life and in your work; and the ability to love others."""
Nine requisites for contented living: Health enough to make work a pleasure. Wealth enough to support your needs. Strength to battle with difficulties and overcome them. Grace enough to confess your sins and forsake them. Patience enough to toil until some good is accomplished. Charity enough to see some good in your neighbor. Love enough to move you to be useful and helpful to others. Faith enough to make real the things of God. Hope enough to remove all anxious fears concerning the future.

"For me, happiness came from prayer to a kindly God, faith in a kindly God, love for my fellow man, and doing the very best I could every day of my life. I had looked for happiness in fast living, but it was not there. I tried to find it in money, but it was not there, either. But when I placed myself in tune with what I believe to be fundamental truths of life, when I began to develop my limited ability, to rid my mind of all kinds of tangled thoughts and fill it with zeal and courage and love, when I gave myself a chance by treating myself decently and sensibly, I began to feel the stimulating, warm glow of happiness."
"There are three ingredients in the good life: learning, earning and yearning."

"To be glad of life, because it gives you the chance to love and to work and to play and to look up at the stars; to be satisfied with your possessions, but not contented with yourself until you have made the best of them; to despise nothing in the world except falsehood and meanness, and to fear nothing except cowardice; to be governed by your admirations rather than by your disgusts; to covet nothing that is your neighbor's except his kindness of heart and gentleness of manners; to think seldom of your enemies, often of your friends, and every day of Christ; and to spend as much time as you can, with body and with spirit, in God's out-of-doors- these are little guideposts on the footpath to peace."
Order your soul; reduce your wants; live in charity; associate in Christian community; obey the laws; trust in Providence.
"Simplicity, clarity, singleness: these are the attributes that give our lives power and vividness and joy."
"To live content with small means; to seek elegance rather than luxury, and refinement rather than fashion; to be worthy, not respectable, and wealthy, not rich; to study hard, think quietly, talk gently, act frankly; to listen to the stars and birds, to babes and sages, with open heart; to bear on cheerfully, do all bravely, awaiting occasions, worry never; in a word to, like the spiritual, unbidden and unconscious, grow up through the common."

"To live and let live, without clamor for distinction or recognition; to wait on divine Love; to write truth first on the tablet of one's own heart-this is the sanity and perfection of living, and my human ideal."
"Do all the good you can, By all the means you can, In all the ways you can, In all the places you can, At all the times you can."
"Go placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender, be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly, and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story. . . . Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labours and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world."
"Accept the pain, cherish the joys, resolve the regrets; then can come the best of benedictions-""If I had my life to live over, I'd do it all the same."""
"The way of a superior man is threefold: Virtuous, he is free from anxieties; wise, he is free from perplexities; bold, he is free from fear."
The first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit. The second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are.

What you become is what counts.
"If an Arab in the desert were suddenly to discover a spring in his tent, and so would always be able to have water in abundance, how fortunate he would consider himself; so too, when a man who ... is always turned toward the outside, thinking that his happiness lies outside him, finally turns inward and discovers that the source is within him."

The happiest people seem to be those who have no particular cause for being happy except that they are so.
I think the inner person is the most important. ... I would like to see an invention that keeps the mind alert. That's what is important.
"I don't think that... one gets a flash of happiness once, and never again; it is there within you, and it will come as certainly as death."
"There is no other solution to man's progress but the day's honest work, the day's honest decisions, the day's generous utterances, and the day's good deed."

Happiness is something that comes into our lives through doors we don't even remember leaving open.
"To seek after beauty as an end, is a wild goose chase, a will-o'-the-wisp, because it is to misunderstand the very nature of beauty, which is the normal condition of a thing being as it should be."

Happiness is never stopping to think if you are.
"It is the paradox of life that the way to miss pleasure is to seek it first. The very first condition of lasting happiness is that a life should be full of purpose, aiming at something outside self."
If you pursue happiness you'll never find it.
Some of us might find happiness if we quit struggling so desperately for it.
"Seek not happiness too greedily, and be not fearful of unhappiness."
"The man of pleasure, by a vain attempt to be more happy than any man can be, is often more miserable than most men."
The bird of paradise alights only on the hand that does not grasp.
The only way to happiness is never to give happiness a thought.
"Everyone chases after happiness, not noticing that happiness is at their heels."
"Seek to do good, and you will find that happiness will run after you."
Deliberately to pursue happiness is not the surest way of achieving it. Seek it for its own sake and I doubt whether you will find it.
"Enjoyment is not a goal, it is a feeling that accompanies important ongoing activity."
If only we'd stop trying to be happy we'd have a pretty good time.
Most men pursue pleasure with such breathless haste that they hurry past it.
"Happiness comes most to persons who seek it least, and think least about it. It is not an object to be sought, it is a state to be induced. It must follow and not lead. It must overtake you, and not you overtake it."
Happiness sneaks in through a door you didn't know you left open.
"Happiness is like a cat. If you try to coax it or call it, it will avoid you. It will never come. But if you pay no attention to it and go about your business, you'll find it rubbing against your legs and jumping into your lap."
One must never look for happiness: one meets it by the way.
They seemed to come suddenly upon happiness as if they had surprised a butterfly in the winter woods.
"Happiness in this world, when it comes, comes incidentally. Make it the object of pursuit, and it leads us on a wild-goose chase, and is never attained. Follow some other object, and very possibly we may find that we have caught happiness without dreaming of it."
Happiness and beauty are by-products. Folly is the direct pursuit of happiness and beauty.

Happiness is action.
I am enjoying to a full that period of reflection which is the happiest conclusion to a life of action.
"Action may not always bring happiness, but there is no happiness without action."
"I want a busy life, a just mind, and a timely death."
Happiness is often the result of being too busy to be miserable.
Painting's not important. The important thing is keeping busy.
"To attain happiness in another world we need only to believe something; to secure it in this world, we must do something."
"To fill the hour, and leave no crevice ... that is happiness."
"If you observe a really happy man, you will find ... that he is happy in the course of living life twenty-four crowded hours of each day."
I find my joy of living in the fierce and ruthless battles of life.

Human happiness and moral duty are inseparably connected.

There is nothing like staying at home for real comfort.
I don't think about whether people will remember me or not. I've been an okay person. I've learned a lot. I've taught people a thing or two. That's what's important.
"What would life be without art? Science prolongs life. To consist of what-eating, drinking, and sleeping? What is the good of living longer if it is only a matter of satisfying the requirements that sustain life? All this is nothing without the charm of art."
It is by studying little things that we attain the great knowledge of having as little misery and as much happiness as possible.

Moderation. Small helpings. Sample a little bit of everything. These are the secrets of happiness and good health.
"The best things are nearest: breath in your nostrils, light in your eyes, flowers at your feet, duties at your hand, the path of God just before you.

"For most of life, nothing wonderful happens. If you don't enjoy getting up and working and finishing your work and sitting down to a meal with family or friends, then the chances are you're not going to be very happy. If someone bases his happiness or unhappiness on major events like a great new job, huge amounts of money, a flawlessly happy marriage or a trip to Paris, that person isn't going to be happy much of the time. If, on the other hand, happiness depends on a good breakfast, flowers in the yard, a drink or a nap, then we are more likely to live with quite a bit of happiness."
The mere sense of living is joy enough.
The true way to soften one's troubles is to solace those of others.

"Happiness is a sunbeam which may pass through a thousand bosoms without losing a particle of its original ray; nay, when it strikes on a kindred heart, like the converged light on a mirror, it reflects itself with redoubled brightness. It is not perfected till it is shared."

"Had laws not been, we never had been blam'd; For not to know we sinn'd is innocence."
Good is when I steal other people's wives and cattle; bad is when they steal mine.
It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer.
As innocent as a new-laid egg.
They that know no evil will suspect none.
Innocence finds not near so much protection as guilt.
No excellent soul is exempt from a mixture of madness.
Mad as a March hare.
I teach that all men are mad.
"Insanity in individuals is something rare - but in groups, parties, nations, and epochs it is the ru)e."
"That he is mad, 'tis true; 'tis true 'tis pity; And pity 'tis 'tis true."
Whom Jupiter would destroy he first drives mad.
"Though this be madness, yet there is method in 't."
No man was ever great without a touch of divine afflatus.
A writer is rarely so well inspired as when he talks about himself.
Inspiration and genius - one and the same.
"Every true man, sir, who is a little above the level of the beasts and plants, lives so as to give a meaning and a value to his own life."
Never let go of that fiery sadness called desire.
For every man there exists a bait which he cannot resist swallowing.
"The moment somebody says to me, ""This is very risky,"" is the moment it becomes attractive to me."
"Discontent is the first step in progress. No one knows what is in him till he tries, and many would never try if they were not forced to."
"All progress is based upon a universal, innate desire on the part of every living organism to live beyond its income."
"It is the spur of ignorance, the consciousness of not understanding, and the curiosity about that which lies beyond that are essential to our progress."
One starts an action simply because one must do something.
"What you are must always displease you, if you would attain to that which you are not."
"If you're good to your staff when things are going well, they'll rally when times go bad."
"Praise out of season, or tactlessly bestowed, can freeze the heart as much as blame."
The pitcher cries for water to carry and a person for work that is real.
Beware of trying to accomplish anything by force.

"Trust your own instinct. Your mistakes might as well be your own, instead of someone else's."
"I feel there are two people inside of me-me and my intuition. If I go against her, she'll screw me every time, and if I follow her, we get along quite nicely."
"I give myself, sometimes, admirable advice, but I am incapable of taking it."
Some of the finest moral intuitions come to quite humble people. The visiting of lofty ideas doesn't depend on formal schooling. Think of those Galilean peasants.
"I'm the foe of moderation, the champion of excess. If I may lift a line from a die-hard whose identity is lost in the shuffle, ""I'd rather be strongly wrong than weakly right."""
Conviction without experiences makes for harshness.
Without fanaticism we cannot accomplish anything.
To have character is to be big enough to take life on.
The trouble is that not enough people have come together with the firm determination to live the things which they say they believe.
"All I can do is act according to my deepest instinct, and be whatever I must be-crazy or ribald or sad or compassionate or loving or indifferent. That is all anybody can do."
Instinct is untaught ability.
Trusting our intuition often saves us from disaster.
Trust your gut.
It is our business to go as we are impelled.
Intuition ... appears to be the extrasensory perception of reality.
Common sense is instinct. Enough of it is genius.
A goose flies by a chart which the Royal Geographical Society could not improve.
I go by instinct. ... I don't worry about experience.
"Unconsciousness, spontaneity, instinct ... hold us to the earth and dictate the relatively good and useful."
"Every time you don't follow your inner guidance, you feel a loss of energy, loss of power, a sense of spiritual deadness."
"Every time a resolve or fine glow of feeling evaporates without bearing fruit, it is worse than a chance lost; it works to hinder future emotions from taking the normal path of discharge."
It is only by following your deepest instinct that you can lead a rich life.
Instinct is the nose of the mind.
"One of the reasons why so few of us ever act, instead of react, is because we are continually stifling our deepest impulses."
"A man should not strive to eliminate his complexes but to get into accord with them, for they are legitimately what directs his conduct in the world."
"If you let your fear of consequence prevent you from following your deepest instinct, your life will be safe, expedient and thin."
Everyone was searching for a formula for survival... and the only formula that worked was no formula. Instinct ... that's all you had to go on.
"I feel there are two people inside me-me and my intuition. If I go against her, she'll screw me every time, and if I follow her, we get along quite nicely."
To be faithful to your instincts and the impulses that carry you in the direction of the excellence you most desire and value ... surely that is to lead the noble life.
"We each need to let our intuition guide us, and then be willing to follow that guidance directly and fearlessly."
"By learning to contact, listen to, and act on our intuition, we can directly connect to the higher power of the universe and allow it to become our guiding force."
"The struggle to learn to listen to and respect our own intuitive, inner promptings is the greatest challenge of all."
"Once you get rid of the idea that you must please other people before you please yourself, and you begin to follow your own instincts-only then can you be successful. You become more satisfied, and when you are, other people tend to be satisfied by what you do."
"If you do not express your own original ideas, if you do not listen to your own being, you will have betrayed yourself."
"Every human being has, like Socrates, an attendant spirit; and wise are they who obey its signals. If it does not always tell us what to do, it always cautions us what not to do."
"Trust the instinct to the end, though you can render no reason."
"The truth of a thing is the feel of it, not the think of it."
Spend time every day listening to what your muse is trying to tell you.
"When I do things without any explanation, but just with spontaneity ... I can be sure that I am right."
Analysis kills spontaneity. The grain once ground into flour germinates no more.
"Spontaneity is the quality of being able to do something just because you feel like it at the moment, of trusting your instincts, of taking yourself by surprise and snatching from the clutches of your well-organized routine a bit of unscheduled pleasure."
"I never believe facts; Canning said nothing was so fallacious as facts, except figures."
Trust your hunches. ... Hunches are usually based on facts filed away just below the conscious level. Warning! Do not confuse your hunches with wishful thinking. This is the road to disaster.
"Facts are not truths; they are not conclusions; they are not even premisses, but in the nature and parts of premisses."
Statistics are no substitute for judgement.
You cannot know what you cannot feel.
"We should chiefly depend not upon that department of the soul which is most superficial and fallible (our reason), but upon that department that is deep and sure, which is instinct."
I make all my decisions on intuition. I throw a spear into the darkness. That is intuition. Then I must send an army into the darkness to find the spear. That is intellect.
Instinct is intelligence incapable of self-consciousness.
"Every advance in social progress removes us more and more from the guidance of instinct, obliging us to depend upon reason for the assurance that our habits are really agreeable to the laws of health."
Follow your instincts. That's where true wisdom manifests itself.
"Impulse without reason is not enough, and reason without impulse is a poor makeshift."
"The shrewd guess, the fertile hypothesis, the courageous leap to a tentative conclusion-these are the most valuable coin of the thinker at work."
"A trembling in the bones may carry a more convincing testimony than the dry, documented deductions of the brain."
Calculation never made a hero.
We are so clothed in rationalization and dissemblance that we can recognize but dimly the deep primal impulses that motivate us.
All our reasoning ends in surrender to feeling.
"Reason, ruling alone, is a force confining; and passion, unattended, is a flame that burns to its own destruction."
Modern man's besetting temptation is to sacrifice his direct perceptions and spontaneous feelings to his reasoned reflections; to prefer in all circumstances the verdict of his intellect to that of his immediate intuitions.
"Decisions, particularly important ones, have always made me sleepy, perhaps because I know that I will have to make them by instinct, and thinking things out is only what other people tell me I should do."
Systems die; instincts remain.
"I do not believe that the deeper problems of living can ever be answered by the process of thought. I believe that life itself teaches us either patience with regard to them, or reveals to us possible solutions when our hearts are pressed close against duties and sorrows and experiences of all kinds."
"Life is one long struggle between conclusions based on abstract ways of conceiving cases, and opposite conclusions prompted by our instinctive perception of them."
Nothing reaches the intellect before making its appearance in the senses.
"Instinct guides the animal better than the man. In the animal it is pure, in man it is led astray by his reason and intelligence."
"Ideas pull the trigger, but instinct loads the gun."
Well-bred instinct meets reason halfway.
Good instincts usually tell you what to do long before your head has figured it out.
Pure logic is the ruin of the spirit.
"When a man begins to reason, he ceases to feel."
A mind all logic is like a knife all blade. It makes the hand bleed that uses it.
"The mind can assert anything, and pretend it has proved it. My beliefs I test on my body, on my intuitional consciousness, and when I get a response there, then I accept."
People who lean on logic and philosophy and rational exposition end by starving the best part of the mind.
"The brain is not, and cannot be, the sole or complete organ of thought and feeling."
Imagination is more important than knowledge.
Some other faculty than the intellect is necessary for the apprehension of reality.
"Command by instinct is swifter, subtler, deeper, more accurate, more in touch with reality than command by conscious mind. The discovery takes one's breath away."
No one is more liable to make mistakes than the man who acts only on reflection.
"Nothing is impossible when we follow our inner guidance, even when its direction may threaten us by reversing our usual logic."
A true history of human events would show that a far larger proportion of our acts are the results of sudden impulses and accident than of that reason of which we so much boast.
It is wisdom to believe the heart.
"I follow my heart, for I can trust it."
The intellect is always fooled by the heart.
There are no rules. Just follow your heart.
"Man becomes man only by his intelligence, but he is man only by his heart."
"It is the heart always that sees, before the head can see."
It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.
Great thoughts always come from the heart.
"It is the heart which experiences God, not the reason."
The heart has reasons which reason cannot understand.
"In making our decisions, we must use the brains that God has given us. But we must also use our hearts, which He also gave us."
Just be what you are and speak from your guts and heart-it's all a man has.
"When love is not madness, it is not love."
"To live is like to love: all reason is against it, and all healthy instinct is for it."
"The thinker philosophizes as the lover loves. Even were the consequences not only useless but harmful, he must obey his impulse."
"What you intuitively desire, that is possible to you."
"Falling in love is one of the activities forbidden that tiresome person, the consistently reasonable man."
If you really want something you can figure out how to make it happen.
Our real duty is always found running in the direction of our worthiest desires.
"The essential conditions of everything you do must be choice, love, passion."
"Passion and prejudice govern the world, only under the name of reason."
The conclusions of passion are the only reliable ones.
"Man is a passion which brings a will into play, which works an intelligence."
"Life is not governed by will or intention. Life is a question of nerves, and fibers, and slowly built-up cells in which thought hides itself, and passion has its dreams."
We do not wish ardently for what we desire only through reason.
Trust your hunches. They're usually based on facts filed away just below the conscious level.
"Inspiration does not come like a bolt, nor is it kinetic energy striving, but it comes to us slowly and quietly and all the time."
Intuition is given only to him who has undergone long preparation to receive it.
"You must train your intuition-you must trust the small voice inside you which tells you exactly what to say, what to decide."
"You have first an instinct, then an opinion, then a knowledge, as the plant has root, bud and fruit. Trust the instinct to the end, though you can render no reason."
A hunch is creativity trying to tell you something.
I move on feeling and have learned to distrust those who don't.
Advice is what we ask for when we already know the answer but wish we didn't.
"Instinct is a powerful form of natural energy, perhaps comparable in humans to electricity or even atomic energy in the mechanical world."
Cherish your emotions and never undervalue them.
"But are not this struggle and even the mistakes one may make better, and do they not develop us more, than if we kept systematically away from emotions?"
"Many a man gets weary of clamping down on his rough impulses, which if given occasional release would encourage the living of life with salt in it, in place of dust."
"We shall keep our horizon perfectly, absolutely, crystallinely open, ready every day for the scouring gales of impulse."
"Intuition is a spiritual faculty and does not explain, but simply points the way."
"Every time I've done something that doesn't feel right, it's ended up not being right."
None of us can estimate what we do when we do it from instinct.
I write out of instinct.
The way to procure insults is to submit to them. A man meets with no more respect than he exacts.
Thou hast added insult to injury.
It is often better not to see an insult than to avenge it.
. . . 'twill turn your eyeballs black and blue.
"Injuries may be forgiven, but not forgotten."
It seldom pays to be rude. It never pays to be only half-rude.
Lloyd George could not see a belt without hitting below it.
"Macaulay is well for awhile, but one wouldn't live under Niagara."
"Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny."
"A fly, Sir, may sting a stately horse and make him wince; but one is but an insect, and the other a horse still."
Calumny is only the noise of madmen.
"To persevere in one's duty and be silent, is the best answer to calumny."
"Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you."
"Young men soon give, and soon forget affronts, Old age is slow in both."
"As long as there are readers to be delighted with calumny, there will be found reviewers to calumniate."
He that flings dirt at another dirtieth himself most.
"It takes your enemy and your friend, working together to hurt you to the heart; the one to slander you and the other to get the news to you."
"Calumny requires no proof. The throwing out of malicious imputations against any character leaves a stain which no after-refutation can wipe out. To create an unfavourable impression, it is not necessary that certain things should be true, but that they have been said."
"It is often better not to see an insult, than to avenge it."
"Abuse a man unjustly, and you will make friends for him."
One of the surest signs of the Philistine is his reverence for the superior tastes of those who put him down.
"Alive, ridiculous, and dead forgot?"
I'll give you an idea of what kind of a guy he was. St. Francis would have punched him in the mouth.
He loves to eat - he puts mayonnaise on an aspirin.
"Apparently, he was not the sharpest quill on the porcupine, if you get my drift."
You might say he was one taco short of a combination platter.
"I can't believe that out of a hundred thousand sperm, you were the quickest."
"Cheap? If he was at the Last Supper, he would have asked for separate checks!"
I've just learned about his illness; let's hope it's nothing trivial.
Why does our host always have tears in his eyes after sex? Due to the pepper spray.
I take him to McDonald's just to watch him eat and see the numbers change.
Mr. Attlee is a very modest man. But then he has much to be modest about.
"After a year of therapy, my psychiatrist said to me, ""Maybe life isn't for everyone."""
"The only way she could get a standing ovation would be if she sang ""The Star-Spangled Banner."""
His voice is to entertainment what the kazoo is to classical music.
"Some people can carry a tune, but they seem to stagger under the load."
"Every word she writes is a lie, including and and the."
"When she told her doctor that she always wanted to keep her weight exactly the same as her IQ, he gave her a lecture on anorexia."
I hope you live to be as old as your jokes.
"If he can remember so many jokes With all the details that mold them, Why can't he recall, with equal skill, All the times he told them!"
I just thought you might like to know that I passed a kennel on the way to the game and your mother is all right.
"Here's a good rule of thumb Too clever, is dumb."
"We should take care not to make the intellect our god; it has, of course, powerful muscles, but no personality."
The intellect is always fooled by the heart.
"The job of intellectuals is to come up with ideas, and all we've been producing is footnotes."
Lord Birkenhead is very clever but sometimes his brains go to his head. All zeal runs down. What replaces it? Intellectualism.
Will and intellect are one and the same thing.
"The highest intellects, like the tops of mountains, are the first to catch and to reflect the dawn."
An intellectual is someone whose mind watches itself.
I hate intellectuals. They are from the top down. I am from the bottom up.
Think sideways!
A conclusion is the place where you got tired of thinking.
The brain is the citadel of sense perception.
"My body has certainly wandered a good deal, but I have an uneasy suspicion that my mind has not wandered enough."
"There are innumerable instances suggesting that modern intellectuals do not believe themselves, that they don't really believe what they say, that they say certain things only in order to assure themselves that they possess opinions and ideas that are different from those that are entertained by the common herd of men."
"Intuition is a spiritual faculty and does not explain, but simply points the way."
The intellect of man is forced to choose Perfection of the life or of the work.
An intellectual is a man who takes more words than necessary to tell more than he knows.
The common sense is that which judges the things given to it by other senses.
"Intelligence is quickness to apprehend as distinct from ability, which is capacity to act wisely on the thing apprehended."
Intuition becomes increasingly valuable in the new information society precisely because there is so much data.
The unluckiest insolvent in the world is the man whose expenditure is too great for his income of ideas.
To the good listener half a word is enough.
Time has a way of demonstrating . . . the most stubborn are the most intelligent.
"Intelligence must follow faith, never precede it, and never destroy it."
"Intelligence is derived from two words - inter and legere - inter meaning 'between' and legere meaning 'to choose'. An intelligent person, therefore, is one who has learned 'to choose between'. He knows that good is better than evil, that confidence should supersede fear, that love is superior to hate, that gentleness is better than cruelty, forbearance than intolerance, compassion than arrogance, and that truth has more virtue than ignorance."
One of the functions of intelligence is to take account of the dangers that come from trusting solely to the intelligence.
The intelligent man who is proud of his intelligence is like the condemned man who is proud of his large cell.
The sign of an intelligent people is their ability to control emotions by the application of reason.
Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.
"I not only use all the brains I have, but all I can borrow."
"Intelligence is not all that important in the exercise of power and is often, in point of fact, useless. Just as a leader doesn't need intelligence, a man in my job doesn't need too much of it either."
The cuckoo who is on to himself is halfway out of the clock.
I've had a lot of experience with people smarter than I am.
"All the crimes on earth do not destroy so many of the human race, nor alienate so much property, as drunkenness."
Bacchus has drowned more men than Neptune.
Of all calamities this is the greatest.
"The smaller the drink, the clearer the head."
Drunkenness is nothing but voluntary madness.
"O God, that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains! that we should, with joy, pleas-ance, revel, and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!"
The devil loves nothing better than the intolerance of reformers.
"It were better to be of no church, than to be bitter for any."
To love oneself is the beginning of a life-long romance.
He that falls in love with himself will have no rivals.
Love yourself first and everything else falls into line.
"Never pretend to a love which you do not actually feel, for love is not ours to command."
Perhaps the feelings that we experience when we are in love represent a normal state. Being in love shows a person who he should be.
The love of liberty is the love of others; the love of power is the love of ourselves.
"Love is like playing the piano. First you must learn to play by the rules, then you must forget the rules and play from your heart."
Love grows by giving. The love we give away is the only love we keep. The only way to retain love is to give it away.
"Without love, benevolence becomes egotism."
You cannot be lonely if you like the person you're alone with.
"Relish love in your old age! Aged love is like aged wine; it becomes more satisfying, more refreshing, more valuable, more appreciated and more intoxicating!"
"Guard within yourself that treasure, kindness. Know how to give without hesitation, how to lose without regret, how to acquire without meanness; know how to replace in your heart, by the happiness of those you love, the happiness that may be wanting to yourself."
"If it is a virtue to love my neighbor as a human being, it must be a virtue - and not a vice - to love myself, since I am a human being too."
"Since love grows within you, so beauty grows. For love is the beauty of the soul."
"Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin as self-neglecting."
Out of love you can speak with straight fury.
"Whate'er th' Almighty's subsequent command, His first command is this - ""Man, love thyself."""
Self-love seems so often unrequited.
"Love is, above all else, the gift of oneself."
A heart that loves is always young.
"Who so loves, believes the impossible."
Accept the things To which fate binds you and Love the people with whom fate Brings you together But do so with all your heart.
"Have you ever been at sea in a dense fog, when it seemed as if a tangible white darkness shut you in and the great ship, tense and anxious, groped her way toward the shore with plummet and sounding-line, and you waited with beating heart for something to happen? I was like that ship before my education began, only I was without compass or sounding line, and no way of knowing how near the harbor was. ""Light! Give me light!"" was the wordless cry of my soul, and rhe light of love shone on me in that very hour."
"Love can be understood only ""from the inside,"" as a language can be understood only by someone who speaks it, as a world can be understood only by someone who lives in it."
"Want, the mistress of invention."
"A tool is but the extension of a man's hand, and a machine is but a complex tool. And he that invents a machine augments the power of a man and the well-being of mankind."
God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.
"When Erin first rose from the dark-swelling flood, God blessed the green island, he saw it was good. The Emerald of Europe, it sparkled and shone In the ring of this world, the most precious stone."
"Whether on the scaffold high. Or on the battle-field we die, Oh, what matter, when for Erin dear we fall."
You may have the universe if I may have Italy.

The joyfulness of a man prolongeth his days.

A thing of beauty is a joy forever.
"Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy."

Knowledge is power.
Man is not weak - knowledge is more than equivalent to force. The master of mechanics laughs at strength.
"To know that we know what we know, and that we do not know what we do not know, that is true knowledge."
The simplest questions are the hardest to answer.
They know enough who know how to learn.

They can expect nothing but their labor for their pains.
"For as labor cannot produce without the use of land, the denial of the equal right to use of land is necessarily the denial of the right of labor to its own produce."
A truly American sentiment recognises the dignity of labor and the fact that honor lies in honest toil.
"Shall you complain who feed the world? Who clothe the world? Who house the world? Shall you complain who are the world, Of what the world may do? As from this hour You use your power, The world must follow you!"
Labor conquers all things.
God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb.
"Mary had a little lamb It's fleece was white as snow, And everywhere that Mary went The lamb was sure to go."

The small landholders are the most precious part of a state.

"But, for my own part, it was Greek to me."

"Rise with the lark, and with the lark to bed."
"Hail to thee, blithe Spirit! Bird thou never wert, That from Heaven, or near it, Pourest thy full heart In profuse strains of unpremeditated art."

"As the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of a fool."
Man is the only creature endowed with the power of laughter.
Man alone suffers so excruciatingly in the world that he was compelled to invent laughter.

Nothing is more silly than silly laughter.

The law of England is a very strange one; it cannot compel anyone to tell the truth. . . . But what the law can do is to give you seven years for not telling the truth.
"Trudeau: Yes, well, there are a lot of bleeding hearts around who just don't like to see people with helmets and guns. All I can say is, go on and bleed, but it is more important to keep law and order in a society than to be worried about weak-kneed people who we don't like the looks of. Reporter: At any cost? How far would you go with that? How far would you extend that? Trudeau: Well, just watch me. . . ."""

Liberty is always unfinished business.
Rights that do not flow from duty well performed are not worth having.
"So free we seem, so fettered fast we are!"

The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way everywhere in the world. The third is freedom from want...everywhere in the world. The fourth is freedom from fear... anywhere in the world.
"Yes, 'n' how many years can some people exist before they're allowed to be free? Yes. 'n' how many times can a man turn his head pretending he just doesn't see? The answer, my friend is blowin' in the wind."
"These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country, but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph."
It is a fair summary of history to say that the safeguards of liberty have frequently been forged in cases involving not very nice people.

Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty. All this will not be finished in the first 100 days. Nor will it be finished in the first 1,000 days, nor in the life of this administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet.

Now the trumpet summons us again - not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need - not as a call to battle, though embattled we are - but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, ""rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation""- a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease and war itself. And so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country .

"All the things I really like to do are either immoral, illegal or fattening."

He was a burning and a shining light.
"Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom, Lead Thou me on! The night is dark, and I am far from home -  Lead Thou me on! Keep Thou my feet; I do not ask to see The distant scene, - one step enough for me."
"And this I know; whether the one True Light Kindle to Love, or Wrath consume me quite, One flash of it within the Tavern caught Better than in the temple lost outright."
"Nature and Nature's laws lay hid in night: God said, ""Let Newton be!"" and all was light."
A light heart lives long.
The one important thing I have learned over the years is the difference between taking one's work seriously and taking one's self seriously. The first is imperative and the second is disastrous.
"Man, unlike the animal, has never learned that the sole purpose of life is to enjoy it."
There is no cure for birth or death save to enjoy the interval.
"Life's better when it's fun. Boy, that's deep, isn't it?"
"When a man is gloomy, everything seems to go wrong; when he is cheerful, everything seems right!"
An ounce of cheerfulness is worth a pound of sadness to serve God with.
Years back someone said cod liver oil was the cure-all! Cheerfulness is more palliative and with no unpleasant aftertaste.
"Cheerfulness keeps up a kind of daylight in the mind, filling it with a steady and perpetual serenity."
"The highest wisdom is continual cheerfulness; such a state, like the region above the moon, is always clear and serene."
"Let us be of good cheer, remembering that misfortunes hardest to bear are those which never come."
Burdens become light when cheerfully borne.
A happy woman is one who has no cares at all; a cheerful woman is one who has cares but doesn't let them get her down.
Even if we can't be happy we must always be cheerful.
"Nature intended you to be the fountain-spring of cheerfulness and social life, and not the mountain of despair and melancholy."
You find yourself refreshed by the presence of cheerful people. Why not make an earnest effort to confer that pleasure on others? Half the battle is gained if you never allow yourself to say anything gloomy.
"Cheerfulness is contagious, but don't wait to catch it from others. Be a carrier."
"If God came in and said, ""I want you to be happy for the rest of your life,"" what would you do?"
"True happiness is to understand our duties toward God and man; to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence on the future; not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears, but to rest satisfied with what we have, which is abundantly sufficient."
"Many people think that if they were only in some other place, or had some other job, they would be happy. Well, that is doubtful. So get as much happiness out of what you are doing as you can and don't put off being happy until some future date."
You're happiest while you're making the greatest contribution.
The happiest and most contented people are those who each day perform to make the best of their abilities.
None but those who are happy in themselves can make others so.
Do you want a world with . . . more joy and happiness? Then find your own joy and happiness and contribute to the joy and happiness of others.
One thing I know; the only ones among you who will be really happy are those who will have sought and found how to serve.
Happiness is a perfume which you cannot pour on someone without getting some on yourself.
Remember that happiness is as contagious as gloom. It should be the first duty of those who are happy to let others know of their gladness.
Those who are happiest are those who do the most for others.
"Make people happy and there will not be half the quarreling, or a tenth part of the wickedness there now is."
"Lead the life that will make you kindly and friendly to everyone about you, and you will be surprised what a happy life you will lead."
"If you want to be happy, set yourself a goal that commands your thoughts, liberates your energy, and inspires your hopes. Happiness is within you. It comes from doing some certain thing into which you can put all your thought and energy. If you want to be happy, get enthusiastic about something."
Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort.
"The way to happiness: keep your heart free from hate, your mind from worry. Live simply, expect little, give much. Fill your life with love. Scatter sunshine. Forget self, think of others. Do as you would be done by. Try this for a week and you will be surprised."
"The happiness of life is made up of minute fractions - the little, soon-forgotten charities of a kiss or smile, a kind look, a heartfelt compliment, and the countless infinitesimals of pleasurable and genial feeling."
"A happy life is made up of little things . . . a gift sent, a letter written, a call made, a recommendation given, transportation provided, a cake made, a book lent, a check sent."
"Do not worry; eat three square meals a day; say your prayers; be courteous to your creditors; keep your digestion good; exercise; go slow and easy. Maybe there are other things your special case requires to make you happy, but my friend, these I reckon will give you a good life."
"The secret of happiness is this: Let your interests be as wide as possible, and let your reactions to the things and persons that interest you be as far as possible friendly rather than hostile."
"The secret of happiness is not in doing what one likes, but in liking what one does."
The secret of happiness is to count your blessings while others are adding up their troubles.

"We have all been placed on this earth to discover our own path, and we will never be happy if we live someone else's idea of life."
"The grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do, something to love, and something to hope for."
But what is happiness except the simple harmony between a man and the life he leads.
"We all have 100% to deal with in our lives: 10% is important, 90% unimportant. The secret to a happy, productive life is to deal with the 10% and let the 90% slip."
"With a little discipline and regular self-checks, you can learn to do one thing at a time. And do it better. And be happier doing it."
"I've been riding the carousel in Central Park since I was five years old . . . If I'm very depressed or if something's bothering me today, my husband, Larry, and I go back to the park. We get on the carousel horse and we start riding, and I start singing at the top of my lungs. It is pure and absolute joy and happiness."
It's never too late to have a happy childhood.
"Life holds so much, so much to be happy about always. Most people ask for happiness on condition. Happiness can be felt only if you don't set any conditions."
"Happiness is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love, grace, and gratitude."
Better to be happy than wise.
"Happiness is a butterfly, which, when pursued, is always just beyond your grasp, but which, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you."
"Your success and happiness lie in you. Resolve to keep happy, and your joy and you shall form an invisible host against difficulties."
"Remember that happiness is a way of travel, not a destination."
"When ill luck besets us, to ease the tension we have only to remember that happiness is relative. The next time you are tempted to grumble about what has happened to you, why not pause and be glad that it is no worse than it is?"
"When one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us."
I have found that most people are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.
It is the happiness that comes from within that is lasting and fulfilling.
"Each person on this planet is inherently, intrinsically capable of attaining ""dizzying heights"" of happiness and fulfillment."
"The ingredients of happiness are so simple that they can be counted on one hand. Happiness comes from within, and rests most securely on simple goodness and clear conscience."
We are never so happy nor so unhappy as we imagine.
"You have to believe in happiness, or happiness never comes."
It is a man's proper business to seek happiness and avoid misery.
The best way to secure future happiness is to be as happy as is rightfully possible today.
"Why should we refuse the happiness this hour gives us, because some other hour might take it away?"
"At the end of our time on earth, if we have lived fully, we will not be able to say, ""I was always happy."" Hopefully, we will be able to say, ""I have experienced a lifetime of real moments, and many of them were happy moments."""
Cherish all your happy moments; they make a fine cushion for old age.
"Happiness is the meaning and the purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence."
The time to be happy is now. The place to be happy is here.
Happiness and love are just a choice away.
"Our happiness depends on the habit of mind we cultivate. So practice happy thinking every day. Cultivate the merry heart, develop the happiness habit, and life will become a continual feast."
"Humor is the healthy way of feeling ""distance"" between one's self and the problem, a way of standing off and looking at one's problems with perspective."
"Humor has great power to heal on an emotional level. You can't hold anger, you can't hold fear, you can't hold hurt while you're laughing."
Humor enables one to live in the midst of tragic events without becoming a tragic figure.
There is no defense against adverse fortune which is so effectual as an habitual sense of humor.
Humor is our way of defending ourselves from life's absurdities by thinking absurdly about them.
"Common sense and a sense of humor are the same thing, moving at different speeds. A sense of humor is just common sense, dancing."
"There is always something to chuckle about. Sometimes we see it. Sometimes . . . we don't. Still, the world is filled with humor. It is there when we are happy and it is there to cheer us up when we are not."
Joy is the most infallible sign of the Presence of God.
"Listen to the clues. The next time you feel real joy, stop and think. Pay attention. Because joy is the universe's way of knocking on your mind's door. Hello in there. Is anyone home? Can I leave a message? Yes? Good I The message is that you are happy, and that means that you are in touch with your purpose."
"Joy of life seems to me to arise from a sense of being where one belongs ... of being foursquare with the life we have chosen. All the discontented people I know are trying sedulously to be something they are not, to do something they cannot do."
"When we align our thoughts, emotions, and actions with the highest part of ourselves, we are filled with enthusiasm, purpose, and meaning. . . . We are joyously and intimately engaged with our world. This is the experience of authentic power."
We have a tendency to obscure the forest of simple joys with the trees of problems.
People need joy quite as much as clothing. Some of them need it far more.
"When large numbers of people share their joy in common, the happiness of each is greater because each adds fuel to the other's flame."
Joys divided are increased.
You increase your joy by increasing the pure joy of others.
"Joy increases as you give it, and diminishes as you try to keep it for yourself. In giving it, you will accumulate a deposit of joy greater than you ever believed possible."
"As you express joy, you draw it out of those you meet, creating joyful people and joyful events. The greater the joy you express, the more joy you experience."
"When we feel joyful, euphoric, happy, we are more open to life, more capable of seeing things clearly and handling daily tensions."
"If we could learn how to balance rest against effort, calmness against strain, quiet against turmoil, we would assure ourselves of joy in living and psychological health for life."
"Simplicity, clarity, singleness: these are the attributes that give our lives power and vividness and joy."
Joy is not in things; it is in us.
Joy is the feeling of grinning on the inside.
"Joy is the will which labors, which overcomes obstacles, which knows triumph."
"It is in the compelling zest of high adventure and of victory, and in creative action, that man finds his supreme joy."
"I believe humans were born to have joy and to have it more abundantly; that the birthright of everyone is loving, caring, sharing, and abundance."
Joy is your birthright.
Blessed are the joymakers.
"Although a lot can be learned from adversity, most of the same lessons can be learned through laughter and joy."
So when you're lonely or sad or bad or blue remember where laughter's hiding . . . it's hiding inside of YOU!
Against the assault of laughter nothing can stand.
"In every job, relationship, or life situation there is inevitably some turbulence. Learn to laugh at it. It is part of what you do and who you are"
"Laughter puts your brain, your central nervous system and your whole being into a state of free play."
Laughing deeply is living deeply.
It has always seemed to me that hearty laughter is a good way to jog internally without having to go outdoors.
A good belly laugh is like taking your liver for a horseback ride.
He laughs best whose laugh lasts.
Shared laughter is like throwing open the shutters in a gloomy room and letting in fresh air and sunshine.
Laughter is the sun that drives winter from the human race.
Shared laughter is love made audible.
A good laugh helps us recognize how ridiculous it is to get excited about matters that are often trivial. . . .
Laughter is the brush that sweeps away the cobwebs of the heart.
"When we can laugh through our tears, we are being given a powerful message. Things may be bad, but they cannot be all that bad."
"The child in you, like all children, loves to laugh, to be around people who can laugh at themselves and life. Children instinctively know that the more laughter we have in our lives, the better."
Laughter is a gift everyone should open.
In the true man there is a child concealed - who wants to play.
"Play keeps us vital and alive. It gives us an enthusiasm for life that is irreplaceable. Without it, life just doesn't taste good."
"It's good to play, and you must keep in practice."
The supreme accomplishment is to blur the line between work and play.
"A little work, a little play, To keep us going - and so, good-day!"
"Every time a man smiles, and much more when he laughs, it adds something to his fragment of life."
"What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. They are but trifles, to be sure; but, scattered along life's pathway, the good they do is inconceivable."
"It's easy enough to be pleasant when everything goes like a song, but the man who is worthwhile, is the man who can smile, when everything goes dead wrong."
"If you have made another person on this earth smile, your life has been worthwhile."
Wrinkles should merely indicate where smiles have been.
"Of all the things you wear, your expression is the most important."
It is only through love that we can attain to communion with God. All living knowledge of God rest upon this foundation: that we experience Him in our lives as Will-to-love.
One word frees us of all the weight and pain of life: That word is love.
It makes no difference how deeply seated may be the trouble; how hopeless the outlook; how muddled the tangle; how great the mistake. A sufficient realization of love will dissolve it all. If only you could love enough you would be the happiest and most powerful being in the world.
Love is the master key which opens the gates of happiness.
"There is only one happiness in life, to love and be loved."
Let no one who loves be called unhappy. Even love unreturned has its rainbow.
"What a grand thing, to be loved! What a grander thing still, to lovel"
To love and be loved is to feel the sun from both sides.
Love . . . binds everything together in perfect harmony.
"For love ... is the blood of life, the power of reunion in the separated."
"It is this intangible thing, love in many forms, which enters into every therapeutic relationship. . . . And it is an element which binds and heals, which comforts and restores, which works what we have to call - for now - miracles."
"This is the miracle that happens every time to those who really love; the more they give, the more they possess."
The one thing we can never get enough of is love. And the one thing we never give enough of is love.
"Love sought is good, but given unsought is better."
Don't shut love out of your life by saying it's impossible to find time. The quickest way to receive love is to give; the fastest way to lose love is to hold it too tightly; and the best way to keep love is to give it wings.
The love we give away is the only one we keep.
"If you would be loved, love and be lovable."
"The issue is not so much being loved but being loving, which leads to the same wonderful feeling you experience when someone loves you."
Everybody forgets the basic thing: people are not going to love you unless you love them.
A loving person lives in a loving world. A hostile person lives in a hostile world: everyone you meet is your mirror.
"Nine times out of ten, when you extend your arms to someone, they will step in, because basically they need precisely what you need."
Love your enemies because they bring out the best in you.
Tolerance and celebration of individual differences is the fire that fuels lasting love.
"Do not waste time bothering whether you ""love"" your neighbor; act as if you did. As soon as we do this we find one of the great secrets. When you are behaving as if you loved someone, you will presently come to love him."
Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
"Love is a force that connects us to every strand of the universe, an unconditional state that characterizes human nature, a form of knowledge that is always there for us if only we can open ourselves to it."
"When we connect with ourselves in love, we can connect with others and the planet in love."
Choose to be a love-finder rather than a faultfinder.
"If you judge people, you have no time to love them."
"Someday, after we have mastered the winds, the waves, the tide and gravity, we shall harness for God the energies of love. Then, for the second time in the history of the world, man will have discovered fire."
Love keeps the cold out better than a cloak.
"In the coldest February, as in every other month in every other year, the best thing to hold on to in this world is each other."
"True love always brings joy to ourself and to the one we love. If our love does not bring joy to both of us, it is not true love."
"True love comes quietly, without banners or flashing lights. If you hear bells, get your ears checked."
"True love is night jasmine, a diamond in darkness, the heartbeat no cardiologist has ever heard. It is the most common of miracles, fashioned of fleecy clouds - a handful of stars tossed into the night sky."
The essence of love is kindness.
Love is what we were born with. Fear is what we learned here.
Love is letting go of fear.
"Love is much nicer to be in than an automobile accident, a tight girdle, a higher tax bracket, or a holding pattern over Philadelphia."
The Eskimos had fifty-two names for snow because it was important to them; there ought to be as many for love.
"Every single one of us can do things that no one else can do can love things that no one else can love . . . We are like violins. We can be used for doorstops, or we can make music."
"But some emotions don't make a lot of noise. It's hard to hear pride. Caring is real faint - like a heartbeat. And pure love why, some days it's so quiet, you don't even know it's there."
Love is not what we become but who we already are.
"Ultimately, love is self-approval."
"Love is, above all, the gift of oneself."
You must love yourself before you love another. By accepting yourself and fully being what you are . . . your simple presence can make others happy.
"It is not what we do, it is how much love we put in the doing."
"Forget the resolutions. Forget control and discipline . . . too much work. Instead try experimenting. Go in search of something to fall in love with. . . something about yourself, your career, your spouse."
Find something you love to do and you'll never have to work a day in your life.
"You will find, as you look back upon your life, that the moments when you really lived are the moments when you have done things in the spirit of love."
We are most alive when we're in love.
"In our life there is a single color, as on an artist's palette, which provides the meaning of life and art. It is the color of love."
Life is a flower of which love is the honey.
No one who has ever brought up a child can doubt for a moment that love is literally the life-giving fluid of human existence.
"Anything will give up its secrets if you love it enough. Not only have I found that when I talk to the little flower or to the little peanut they will give up their secrets, but I have found that when I silently commune with people they give up their secrets also - if you love them enough."
"A five-word sentence that could change the world tomorrow is ""What would love do now?"""
"Do not seek perfection in a changing world. Instead, perfect your love."
Every day we are offered new means for learning and growing in love.
"Spend a moment, every day, thinking of someone to love."
Ultimately love is everything.
What the world really needs is more love and less paperwork.
Love doesn't make the world go 'round. Love is what makes the ride worthwhile.
"Love is how you stay alive, even after you are gone."
Birds of a feather flock together.
"Like mother, like daughter."
One crow will not pick out another crow's eyes.
"Like will to like, each creature loves his kind."
"Like father, like son."
I shall not look upon his like again.
"His heart was as great as the world, but there was no room in it to hold the memory of a wrong."
"Honesty rare as a man without self-pity, Kindness as large and plain as a prairie wind."
"The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting, While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring; But O heart! heart! heart! O the bleeding drops of red, Where on the deck my captain lies, Fallen cold and dead."
The lion is not so fierce as they paint him.
Do not pluck the beard of a dead lion.
A lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing.
It is not good to wake a sleeping lion.
"From listening comes wisdom, and from speaking repentance."
"A good listener is not only popular everywhere, but after a while he knows something."
"I am never long, even in the society of her I love, without yearning for the company of my lamp and my library."

A novel is a mirror carried along a main road.

The novel is a prose narrative of some length that has something wrong with it.
All that non-fiction can do is answer questions. It's fiction's business to ask them.

One hears about life all the time from different people with very different narrative gifts.

The answers you get from literature depend upon the questions you pose.
The classics are only primitive literature. They belong to the same class as primitive machinery and primitive music and primitive medicine.
Biography is one of the new terrors of death.
"A biography is considered complete if it merely accounts for six or seven selves, whereas a person may well have as many as a thousand."

The classics are only primitive literature. They belong to the same class as primitive machinery and primitive music and primitive medicine.
"The difference between literature and journalism is that journalism is unreadable, and literature is not read."
Logic is logic. That's all I say.
"Logic is neither a science nor an art, but a dodge."
"Grammar is the logic of speech, even as logic is the grammar of reason."
"A mighty mass of brick, and smoke, and shipping, Dirty and dusty, but as wide as eye Could reach, with here and there a sail just skipping In sight, then lost amidst the forestry Of masts; a wilderness of steeples peeping On tiptoe through their sea-coal canopy; A huge, dun cupola, like a fools-cap crown On a fool's head - and there is London Town."
"London is a roost, for every bird."
Jealousy is no more than feeling alone against smiling enemies.
"To be adult is to be alone (etre adulte, c'est etre seul)."
What loneliness is more lonely than distrust.
Loneliness is and always has been the central and inevitable experience of every man.
"One may have a blazing hearth in one's soul, and yet no one ever comes to sit by it."
So lonely 'twas that God himself scarce seemed there to be.
The lonely one offers his hand too quickly to whomever he encounters.
Man's loneliness is but his fear of life.
"No man is an Island intire of it self; every man is a peece of the Continent, a part of the maine; if a Clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the lesse, as well as if a Promontorie were, as well as if a manor of thy friends or thine own were. Any man's death diminishes me because I am involved in Mankinde, and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee."
Who knows what true loneliness is - not the conventional word but the naked terror? To the lonely themselves it wears a mask. The most miserable outcast hugs some memory or some illusion.
"Little do men perceive what solitude is, and how far it extendeth. For a crowd is not company, and faces are but a gallery of pictures, and talk but a tinkling cymbal, where there is no love."
"Where you used to be, there is a hole in the world, which I find myself constantly walking around in the daytime, and falling into at night. I miss you like hell."

Definition of a bridegroom: A man who is amazed at the outcome of what he thought was a harmless little flirtation.
"After fifteen years of marriage, my wife wants us to recommit our vows. As a man, I don't understand her need to get married again. We've got our toaster, let's move on."

"Have patience with all things, but chiefly have patience with yourself. Do not lose courage in considering your own imperfections, but instantly set about remedying them-every day begin the task anew."
Each day is a little life; every waking and rising a little birth; every fresh morning a little youth; every going to rest and sleep a little death.
I love the challenge of starting at zero every day and seeing how much I can accomplish.
"Whether one is twenty, forty, or sixty; whether one has succeeded, failed or just muddled along; whether yesterday was full of sun or storm, or one of those dull days with no weather at all, life begins each morning! ... Each morning is the open door to a new world-new vistas, new aims, new tryings."
"To be seeing the world made new every morning, as if it were the morning of the first day, and then to make the most of it for the individual soul as if each were the last day, is the daily curriculum of the mind's desire."
"Do not say, ""It is morning,"" and dismiss it with a name of yesterday. See it for the first time as a newborn child that has no name."
"God had infinite time to give us.... He cut it up into a near succession of new mornings, and, with each, therefore, a new idea, new inventions, and new applications."
We are new every day.
"No matter how big or soft or warm your bed is, you still have to get out of it."
"Spill not the morning (the quintessence of the day!) in recreations, for sleep is a recreation. Add not, therefore, sauce to sauce. ... Pastime, like wine, is poison in the morning. It is then good husbandry to sow the head, which hath lain fallow all night, with some serious work."
"Do not shorten the morning by getting up late; look upon it as the quintessence of life, and to a certain extent sacred."
"Let us then be up and doing, with a heart for any fate."
"He'd jolt up in bed every morning, sit quietly for a moment, and you could feel those wheels spinning in his mind as he planned his day. Then he'd hit the floor almost on the run."

I thank You God for this most amazing day; for the leaping greenly spirits of trees and a blue true dream of sky; and for everything which is natural which is infinite which is yes.
"I get up and I bless the light thin clouds and the first twittering of birds, and the breathing air and smiling face of the hills."
"I'm a most lucky and thankful woman. Lucky and thankful for each morning I wake up. For three wonderful daughters and one son. For an understanding and very loving husband with whom I've shared fifty-two blessed years, all in good health."
"If God adds another day to our life, let us receive it gladly."
Here we stand between two eternities of darkness. What are we to do with this glory while it is still ours?
"Your morning thoughts may determine your conduct for the day. Optimistic thoughts will make your day bright and productive, while pessimistic thinking will make it dull and wasteful. Face each day cheerfully, smilingly and courageously, and it will naturally follow that your work will be a real pleasure and progress will be a delightful accomplishment."
You should always know when you're shifting gears in life. You should leave your era; it should never leave you.
"The first thing each morning, and the last thing each night, suggest to yourself specific ideas that you wish to embody in your character and personality. Address such suggestions to yourself, silently or aloud, until they are deeply impressed upon your mind."
"Everyday ask yourself the question, ""Do I want to experience Peace of Mind or do I want to experience Conflict ?"""
"It was only a sunny smile, And little it cost in the giving. But like morning light, it scattered the night, And made the day worth living."
To get up each morning with the resolve to be happy ... is to set our own conditions to the events of each day. To do this is to condition circumstances instead of being conditioned by them.
"Today is a new day. You will get out of it just what you put into it. ... If you have made mistakes, even serious mistakes, there is always another chance for you. And supposing you have tried and failed again and again, you may have a fresh start any moment you choose, for this thing that we call ""failure"" is not the falling down, but the staying down."
"When you rise in the morning, form a resolution to make the day a happy one for a fellow creature."
"As soon as you open your eyes in the morning, you can square away for a happy and successful day. It's the mood and the purpose at the inception of each day that are the important facts in charting your course for the day. We can always square away for a fresh start, no matter what the past has been."
"This is the beginning of a new day. God has given me this day to use as I will. I can waste it or use it for good, but what I do today is important, because I am exchanging a day of my life for it! When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, leaving in its place something that I have traded for it. I want it to be gain, and not loss; good, and not evil; success, and not failure; in order that I shall not regret the price I have paid for it."
"I think in terms of the day's resolutions, not the year's."
Every new day begins with possibilities. It's up to us to fill it with the things that move us toward progress and peace.
"Here hath been dawning another blue day: think, wilt thou let it slip useless away?"
Be pleasant until ten o'clock in the morning and the rest of the day will take care of itself.
"Today a thousand doors of enterprise are open to you, inviting you to useful work. To live at this time is an inestimable privilege, and a sacred obligation devolves upon you to make right use of your opportunities. Today is the day in which to attempt and achieve something worthwhile."
"Get out of bed forcing a smile. You may not smile because you are cheerful; but if you will force yourself to smile you'll... be cheerful because you smile. Repeated experiments prove that when man assumes the facial expression of a given mental mood, any given mood, then that mental mood itself will follow."
He who every morning plans the transactions of the day and follows that plan carries thread that will guide him through the labyrinth of the most busy life.
A man without a plan for the day is lost before he starts.
Never be afraid to sit awhile and think.
"Only the thinking man lives his life, the thoughtless man's life passes him by."
"My credo is etched on my mirror in my bathroom and I see it when I brush my teeth in the morning. It says, ""Don't worry, Be Happy, Feel Good."" When you see that first thing, and you reflect on it, the rest of the day seems to glide by pretty well."
Only that day dawns to which we are awake.
"The day returns and brings us the petty round of irritating concerns and duties. Help us to play the man, help us to perform them with laughter and kind faces; let cheerfulness abound with industry. Give us to go blithely on our business all this day, bring us to our resting beds weary and content and undishonored, and grant us in the end the gift of sleep."
"A day dawns, quite like other days; in it, a single hour comes, quite like other hours; but in that day and in that hour the chance of a lifetime faces us."
One never knows what each day is going to bring. The important thing is to be open and ready for it.
"Great opportunities come to all, but many do not know they have met them. The only preparation to take advantage of them is ... to watch what each day brings."
"There will be something, anguish or elation, that is peculiar to this day alone. I rise from sleep and say: Hail to the morning! Come down to me, my beautiful unknown."
The sun is new each day.
Someday the sun is going to shine down on me in some faraway place.
"With every rising of the sun, think of your life as just begun."
I feel very happy to see the sun come up every day. I feel happy to be around. ... I like to take this day- any day-and go to town with it.
"Look to the East, where up the lucid sky The morning climbs! The day shall yet be fair."
"Each golden sunrise ushers in new opportunities for those who retain faith in themselves, and keep their chins up.... Meet the sunrise with confidence. Fill every golden minute with right thinking and worthwhile endeavor. Do this and there will be joy for you in each golden sunset."
"Today a new sun rises for me; everything lives, everything is animated, everything seems to speak to me of my passion, everything invites me to cherish it."
"What humbugs we are, who pretend to live for Beauty, and never see the Dawn!"
Sunrise: day's great progenitor.
Put yourself in competition with yourself each day. Each morning look back upon your work of yesterday and then try to beat it.
The morning has gold in its mouth.
Do you know what the greatest test is? Do you still get excited about what you do when you get up in the morning?
"Oft when the white, still dawn lifted the skies and pushed the hills apart, I have felt it like a glory in my heart."
Sometimes I have believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.
"The mind is found most acute and most uneasy in the morning. Uneasiness is, indeed, a species of sagacity-a passive sagacity. Fools are never uneasy."
Day's sweetest moments are at dawn.
"All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust."
"Oh, why should the spirit of mortal be proud? Like a fast-flitting meteor, a fast-flying cloud, A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave, He passes from life to his rest in the grave."
The mother of all living.
"She's somebody's mother, boys, you know, For all she's aged and poor and slow."
"A mother is a mother still, The holiest thing alive."
Men are what their mothers made them.
What is home without a mother?
"There is none, In all this cold and hollow world, no fount Of deep strong, deathless love, save that within A mother's heart."
"If I were hanged on the highest hill, Mother o' mine, O mother o' mine! I know whose love would follow me still, Mother o' mine, O mother o' mine!"
"All that I am or hope to be, I owe to my angel mother."
I arose a mother in Israel.
The bravest battle that ever was fought; Shall I tell you where and when? On the maps of the world you will find it not; It was fought by the mothers of men.
"Who ran to help me when I fell, And would some pretty story tell, Or kiss the place to make it well? My Mother."
For the hand that rocks the cradle Is the hand that rules the world.
"Sure I love the dear silver that shines in your hair, And the brow that's all furrowed, and wrinkled with care. I kiss the dear fingers, so toil-worn for me, Oh, God bless you and keep you, Mother Machree."

"There are three books my daughter felt were the most important influences in her life: the Bible, her mother's cookbook, and her father's checkbook."
Grandchildren don't make a man feel old; it's the knowledge that he's married to a grandmother.
Dad named his first ulcer after me.
"It is a wise child that knows its own father, and an unusual one that unreservedly approves of him."
Before I got married I had six theories about bringing up children; now I have six children and no theories.
"When I was a boy of fourteen, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be twenty-one, I was astonished at how much he had learned in seven years."
"My mother phones daily to ask, ""Did you just try to reach me?"" When I reply no, she adds, ""So, if you're not too busy, call me while I'm still alive,"" . . . and hangs up."
Most men are secretly still mad at their mothers for throwing away their comic books. They would be valuable now.
There's no such thing as a nonworking mother.
"God could not be everywhere, and therefore he made mothers."
"MOTHER TO TEENAGER ON SUNDAY MORNING: I believe I heard the clock strike one when you came in last night. teen: Well, I know how much you need your sleep, so it was going to strike ten but I stopped it at one chime."
I hope I look as good as my mother does when I reach the age she says she isn't.
I found out why cats drink out of the toilet. My mother told me it's because it's cold in there. And I'm like: How did my mother know that?
The most remarkable thing about my mother is that for thirty years she served the family nothing but leftovers. The original meal has never been found.

"Where the willingness is great, the difficulties cannot be great."
"Talent isn't enough. You need motivation-and persistence, too: what Steinbeck called a blend of faith and arrogance.

Never let go of that fiery sadness called desire.
"It seems to me we can never give up longing and wishing while we are alive. There are certain things we feel to be beautiful and good, and we must hunger for them."
"One man with a dream, at pleasure, Shall go forth and conquer a crown, And three with a new song's measure, Can trample an empire down."

Wagner's music is better than it sounds.
"Light quirks of music, broken and uneven, Make the soul dance upon a jig to Heav'n."

"The kiss of sun for pardon, The song of the birds for mirth One is nearer God's Heart in a garden Than anywhere else on earth."

"For many years I was self-appointed inspector of snowstorms and rainstorms, and did my duty faithfully, though I never received one cent for it."
"The next time it begins to rain ... lie down on your belly, nestle your chin into the grass, and get a frog's-eye view of how raindrops fall . . . The sight of hundreds of blades of grass bowing down and popping back up like piano keys strikes me as one of the merriest sights in the world."
"Sunshine is delicious, rain is refreshing, wind braces us up, snow is exhilarating; there is really no such thing as bad weather, only different kinds of good weather."

"Today is a new day. You will get out of it just what you put into it. . . If you have made mistakes, even serious mistakes, there is always another chance for you. . . . for this thing that we call ""failure"" is not the falling down, but the staying down."
Finish each day and be done with it. You have done what you could; some blunders and absurdities have crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day; you shall begin it serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense.
"Live your life each day as you would climb a mountain. An occasional glance toward the summit keeps the goal in mind, but many beautiful scenes are to be observed from each new vantage point. Climb slowly, steadily, enjoying each passing moment; and the view from the summit will serve as a fitting climax for the journey."
Nothing is worth more than this day.
Write it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year.

"I like to visit New York, but I wouldn't live there if you gave it to me."
"If there ever was an aviary overstocked with jays it is that Yaptown-on-the-Hudson, called New York."
"Vulgar of manner, overfed. Overdressed and underbred; Heartless, Godless, hell's delight, Rude by day and lewd by night; Bedwarfed the man, o'ergrown the brute, Ruled by boss and prostitute; Purple-robed and pauper-clad, Raving, rotting, money-mad; A squirming herd in Mammon's mesh, A wilderness of human flesh; Crazed with avarice, lust and rum, New York, thy name's Delirium."
Spick and span new.
"What is valuable is not new, and what is new is not valuable."
"If a man bites a dog, that is news."
By evil report and good report.
"As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country."
There's villainous news abroad.
When we hear news we should always wait for the sacrament of confirmation.
Freedom of the press in Britain is freedom to print such of the proprietor's prejudices as the advertisers don't object to.
"Newspapers have developed what might be called a vested interest in catastrophe. If they can spot a fight, they play up that fight. If they can uncover a tragedy, they will headline that tragedy."
"Everything you read in the newspapers is absolutely true, except for that rare story of which you happen to have first-hand knowledge."
"I do not take a single newspaper, nor read one a month and I feel myself infinitely the happier for it."
"Burke said there were three Estates in Parliament; but in the reporters' gallery yonder, there sat a fourth Estate more important than them all."
Comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.
"Remember, son, many a good story has been ruined by over-verification."
"Don't be afraid to make a mistake, your readers might like it."
One newspaper a day ought to be enough for anyone who still prefers to retain a little mental balance.
Journalism is literature in a hurry.
"The sports page records people's accomplishments, the front page usually records nothing but man's failures."
"If some great catastrophe is not announced every morning, we feel a certain void. 'Nothing in the paper today,' we sigh."
"Carelessness is not fatal to journalism, nor are cliches, for the eye rests lightly on them. But what is intended to be read once can seldom be read more than once; a journalist has to accept the fact that his work, by its very todayness, is excluded from any share in tomorrow."
"He had been kicked in the head by a mule when young, and believed everything he read in the Sunday papers."
"An editor - a person employed on a newspaper, whose business it is to separate the wheat from the chaff, and to see that the chaff is printed."
The day you write to please everyone you no longer are in journalism. You are in show business.
News is the first rough draft of history.
It is a newspaper's duty to print the news and raise hell.
"What you see is news, what you know is background, what you feel is opinion."
Freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one.
A good newspaper is a nation talking to itself.
"The first essence of journalism is to know what you want to know; the second, is to find out who will tell you."
Today's reporter is forced to become an educator more concerned with explaining the news than with being first on the scene.
"A writer who takes up journalism abandons the slow tempo of literature for a faster one and the change will do him harm. By degrees the flippancy of journalism will become a habit and the pleasure of being paid on the nail and more especially of being praised on the nail, grow indispensable."
Newspapers are the world's mirrors.
"Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter."
Every editor of newspapers pays tribute to the devil.
Four hostile newspapers are more to be feared than a thousand bayonets.
"Let me make the newspapers, and I care not what is preached in the pulpit or what is enacted in Congress."
AH I know is what I see in the papers.
"The Night has a thousand eyes, The Day but one; Yet the light of the bright world dies With the dying sun."
For the night Shows stars and women in a better light.
Night's black Mantle covers all alike.
"Watchman, what of the night?"
"Night, when deep sleep falleth on men."
The night cometh when no man can work.
"And the night shall be filled with music And the cares, that infest the day, Shall fold their tents, like the Arabs, And as silently steal away."
In a real dark night of the soul it is always three o'clock in the morning.
The nearer the dawn the darker the night.
"The night is dark, and I am far from home."
"To all, to each, a fair good night, And pleasing dreams; and slumbers light."
Making night hideous.
It is the hour when from the boughs The nightingale's high note is heard; It is the hour when lovers' vows Seem sweet in every whisper'd word.
"Hark! that's the nightingale, Telling the self-same tale Her song told when this ancient earth was young: So echoes answered when her song was sung In the first wooded vale."
"The angel of spring, the mellow-throated nightingale."
"I am not the smartest or most talented person in the world, but I succeeded because I keep going, and going, and going."
"I know the price of success: dedication, hard work and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen."
Victory belongs to the most persevering.
Success generally depends upon knowing how long it takes to succeed.
Success seems to be largely a matter of hanging on after others have let go.
"If you wish success in life, make perseverance your bosom friend."
"They who are the most persistent, and work in the true spirit, will invariably be the most successful."
"If at first you don't succeed, try, try, try again."
"If at first you don't succeed, you're running about average."
The secret of success is constancy of purpose.
"The only way to the top is by persistent, intelligent, hard work."
"The heights by great men reached and kept Were not attained by sudden flight, But they, while their companions slept Were toiling upward in the night."
"I realized early on that success was tied to not giving up. Most people in this business gave up and went on to other things. If you simply didn't give up, you would outlast the people who came in on the bus with you."
"Call the roll in your memory of conspicuously successful [business] giants and, if you know anything about their careers, you will be struck by the fact that almost every one of them encountered inordinate difficulties sufficient to crush all but the gamest of spirits. Edison went hungry many times before he became famous."
"Perseverance is a great element of success. If you only knock long enough and loud enough at the gate, you are sure to wake up somebody."
"Four steps to achievement: plan purposefully, prepare prayerfully, proceed positively, pursue persistently."
"Flaming enthusiasm, backed up by horse sense and persistence, is the quality that most frequently makes for success."
Diamonds are only lumps of coal that stuck to their jobs.
"Persistence is the master virtue. Without it, there is no other."
"I'm hardnosed about luck. I think it sucks. Yeah, if you spend seven years looking for a job as a copywriter, and then one day somebody gives you a job, you can say, ""Gee, I was lucky I happened to go up there today."" But dammit, I was going to go up there sooner or later in the next seventy years. ... If you're persistent in trying and doing and working, you almost make your own fortune."
It's the plugging away that will win you the day So don't be a piker old pard! Just draw on your grit; it's so easy to quit- It's the keeping your chin up that's hard.
No one succeeds without effort. ... Those who succeed owe their success to their perseverance.
Big shots are only little shots who keep shooting.
"Be of good cheer. Do not think of today's failures, but of the success that may come tomorrow. You have set yourselves a difficult task, but you will succeed if you persevere; and you will find a joy in overcoming obstacles. Remember, no effort that we make to attain something beautiful is ever lost."
The way to succeed is never quit. That's it. But really be humble about it.... You start out lowly and humble and you carefully try to learn an accretion of little things that help you get there.
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going.
Continuous efforts-not strength or intelligence-is the key to unlocking our potential.
Plodding wins the race.
The difficulties and struggles of today are but the price we must pay for the accomplishments and victories of tomorrow.
Let me tell you the secret that has led me to my goal: my strength lies solely in my tenacity.
A winner never quits and a quitter never wins.
"Men who have attained things worth having in this world have worked while others idled, have persevered when others gave up in despair, have practiced early in life the valuable habits of self-denial, industry, and singleness of purpose. As a result, they enjoy in later life the success so often erroneously attributed to good luck."
"In the realm of ideas, everything depends on enthusiasm; in the real world, all rests on perseverance."
There's such a thin line between winning and losing.
It is easier to begin well than to finish well.
The great majority of men are bundles of beginnings.
I hope I shall have ambition until the day I die.
"When you put your hand to the plow, you can't put it down until you get to the end of the row."
"Out of the strain of the Doing, Into the peace of the Done."
"Great is the art of beginning, but greater is the art of ending."
"There are two parts to the creative endeavor: making something, then disseminating it."
"We rate ability in men by what they finish, not by what they begin."
A chicken doesn't stop scratching just because worms are scarce.
"Everyone has his superstitions. One of mine has always been when I started to go anywhere, or to do anything, never to turn back or to stop until the thing intended was accomplished."
"I just kept on doing what everyone starts out doing. The real question is, why did other people stop?"
Men perish because they cannot join the beginning with the end.
Business is full of brilliant men who started out with a spurt and lacked the stamina to finish. Their places were taken by patient and unshowy plodders who never knew when to quit.
I can remember walking as a child. It was not customary to say you were fatigued. It was customary to complete the goal of the expedition.
He that has cut the claws of the lion will not feel quite secure until he has also drawn his teeth.
Courage to start and willingness to keep everlasting at it are the requisites for success.
"I went for years not finishing anything. Because, of course, when you finish something you can be judged.... I had poems which were rewritten so many times I suspect it was just a way of avoiding sending them out."
"Let no one 'til his death be called unhappy. Measure not the work Until the day's out, and the labor done: Then bring your gauges."
All is well that ends well.
"Either do not attempt at all, or go through with it."
In soloing-as in other activities-it is far easier to start something than it is to finish it.
It is a matter first of beginning-and then following through.
"Genius begins great works, labor alone finishes it."
There is but an inch of difference between the cushioned chamber and the padded cell.
The only way to find out if you can write is to set aside a certain period every day and try. Save enough money to give yourself six months to be a full-time writer. Work every day and the pages will pile up.
"I work every day-or at least I force myself into my office or room. I may get nothing done, but you don't earn bonuses without putting in time. Nothing may come for three months, but you don't earn the fourth without it."
"When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that blow that did it, but all that had gone before."
"The drops of rain make a hole in the stone not by violence, but by oft falling."
"It does not matter how slowly you go, so long as you do not stop."
Live with no time out.
"The great thing in this world is not so much where we are, but in what direction we are moving."
"The race is not always to the swift, but to those who keep on running."
My parents told me that people will never know how long it takes you to do something. They will only know how well it is done.
By perseverance the snail reached the Ark.
"Our desire must be like a slow and stately ship, sailing across endless oceans, never in search of safe anchorage. Then suddenly, unexpectedly, it will find mooring for a moment."
"The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong."
"If we are facing in the right direction, all we have to do is keep on walking."
"It's the steady, constant driving to the goal for which you're striving, not the speed with which you travel, that will make your victory sure."
"I'm a slow walker, but I never walk back."
Slow and steady wins the race.
"Character is built into the spiritual fabric of personality hour by hour, day by day, year by year in much the same deliberate way that physical health is built into the body."
No great thing is created suddenly.
"Be content to grow a little each day. If the improvement is the sort of thing which is very slow, do not measure it too often. Do a self-comparison every two weeks, or every six months, whatever is appropriate."
Pray that success will not come any faster than you are able to endure it.
Wisely and slow. They stumble that run fast.
Plodding wins the race.
The way of progress is neither swift nor easy.
"One thing at a time, all things in succession. That which grows slowly endures."
Make haste slowly.
Slow motion gets you there faster.
"I'm not there yet, but I'm closer than I was yesterday."
Life begins on the other side of despair.
I am suffocated and lost when I have not the bright feeling of progression.
The lowest ebb is the turn of the tide.
"You give ioo percent in the first half of the game, and if that isn't enough, in the second half you give what's left."
"Don't get hung up on a snag in the stream, my dear. Snags are not so dangerous-it's the debris that clings to them that makes the trouble. Pull yourself loose and go on."
One can go a long way after one is tired.
"The great thing, and the hard thing, is to stick to things when you have outlived the first interest, and not yet got the second, which comes with a sort of mastery."
Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit.
"If something is boring after two minutes, try it for four. If still boring, try for eight, sixteen, thirty-two, and so on. Eventually, one discovers that it is not boring, but very interesting."
No one ever did anything worth doing unless he was prepared to go on with it long after it became something of a bore.
"I've been failing for like, ten or eleven years. When it turns, it'll turn. Right now I'm just tryin' to squeeze through a very tight financial period, get the movie out, and put my things in order."
"In our day, when a pitcher got into trouble in a game, instead of taking him out, our manager would leave him in and tell him to pitch his way out of trouble."
"I'm a little wounded, but I am not slain; I will lay me down to bleed a while. Then I'll rise and fight again."
"The tragedy of life is not that man loses, but that he almost wins."
Where I am today has everything to do with the years I spent hanging on to a career by my fingernails.
Courage is fear holding on a minute longer.
"A hero is no braver than an ordinary man, but he is brave five minutes longer."
"Hope says to us constantly, ""go on, go on,"" and leads us to the grave."
"Every great work, every big accomplishment, has been brought into manifestation through holding to the vision, and often just before the big achievement, comes apparent failure and discouragement."
"The line between failure and success is so fine that we ... are often on the line and do not know it. How many a man has thrown up his hands at a time when a little more effort, a little more patience, would have achieved success. A little more persistence, a little more effort, and what seemed hopeless failure may turn to glorious success."
"When you get to the end of your rope, tie a knot and hang on."
"It is with enterprises as with striking fire; we do not meet with success except with reiterated efforts, and often at the instant when we despaired of success."
Saints are sinners who kept on going.
We can do anything we want to do if we stick to it long enough.
"When you get into a tight place and everything goes against you, 'til it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn."
"Men do not fail, they stop trying."
It ain't over 'til it's over.
Triumph often is nearest when defeat seems inescapable.
"Don't bother about genius. Don't worry about being clever. Trust to hard work, perseverance and determination. And the best motto for a long march is, ""Don't grumble. Plug on!"""
"Some men give up their designs when they have almost reached the goal; while others, on the contrary, obtain a victory by exerting, at the last moment, more vigorous efforts than before."
Never stop. One always stops as soon as something is about to happen.
Many of life's failures are men who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.
"Fight one more round. When your feet are so tired you have to shuffle back to the center of the ring, fight one more round."
Don't leave before the miracle happens!
"If something doesn't come up the way you want, you have to forge ahead."
"Fortune is like the market, where many times, if you can stay a little, the price will fall."
"This man Wellington is so stupid he does not know when he is beaten, and goes on fighting."
He never knew when he was whipped ... so he never was.
"Entrepreneurs average 3.8 failures before a final success. What sets the successful ones apart is their amazing persistence. There are a lot of people out there with good and marketable ideas, but pure entrepreneurial types almost never accept defeat."
"As long as a person doesn't admit he is defeated, he is not defeated-he's just a little behind, and isn't through fighting."
"Only yield when you must, never ""give up the ship,"" but fight on to the last ""with a stiff upper lip!"""
Defeat never comes to any man until he admits it.
There is something in me-I just can't stand to admit defeat.
There was no such thing as defeat if you didn't accept it.
"Never give in! Never give in! Never, never, never, never.... In nothing great or small, large or petty, never give in except to convictions or honor and good sense!"
"First there are those who are winners, and know they are winners. Then there are the losers who know they are losers. Then there are those who are not winners, but don't know it. They're the ones for me. They never quit trying. They're the soul of our game."
It's not worthy of human beings to give up.
Never admit defeat!
"We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields, and in the streets, we shall fight in the halls. We shall never surrender."
Patient endurance attends to all things.
To be somebody you must last.
He conquers who endures.
"Emotional maturity is the ability to stick to a job and to struggle through until it is finished, to endure unpleasantness, discomfort and frustration."
To bear is to conquer our fate.
Keep breathing.
"It helps, I think, to consider ourselves on a very long journey: the main thing is to keep to the faith, to endure, to help each other when we stumble or tire, to weep and press on."
"The first and final thing you have to do in this world is to last in it, and not be smashed by it."
"The first need of being is endurance; to endure with gladness if we can, with fortitude in any event."
"I bend, but I do not break."
He that endureth to the end shall be saved.
"Whatever necessity lays upon thee, endure; whatever she commands, do."
To be somebody you must last.
"In the clutch of circumstance, I have not winced or cried aloud; Under the bludgeoning of chance, my head is bloody, but unbowed."
"We shall live to fight again, and to strike another blow."
Giving up is the ultimate tragedy.
God Almighty hates a quitter.
"Endurance is one of the most difficult disciplines, but it is to the one who endures that the final victory comes."
"Endure, and preserve yourselves for better things."
Every kind of fortune is to be overcome by bearing it.
"When we see ourselves in a situation which must be endured and gone through, it is best to make up our minds to meet it with firmness, and accommodate everything to it in the best way practical. This lessons the evil, while fretting and fuming only serve to increase your own torments."
"If you want to see the sun shine, you have to weather the storm."
"If you want the rainbow, you gotta put up with the rain."
"What cannot be altered must be borne, not blamed."
He that can't endure the bad will not live to see the good.
"To struggle when hope is banished. To live when life's salt is gone! To dwell in a dream that's vanished- To endure, and go calmly on!"
"A high heart ought to bear calamities and not flee them, since in bearing them appears the grandeur of the mind, and in fleeing them the cowardice of the heart."
"Endurance is nobler than strength, and patience than beauty."
They merit more praise who know how to suffer misery than those who temper themselves with contentment.
We must endure what fortune sends.
People can bear anything.
We must learn from life how to suffer it.
This is courage in a man: to bear unflinchingly what heaven sends.

Jesus taught that perseverance is the essential element of prayer. Men must be in earnest when they kneel at God's footstool. Too often we get faint-hearted and quit praying at the point when we ought to begin. We let go at the very point where we should hold on strongest. Our prayers are weak because they are not impassioned by an unfailing and resistless will.

A sense of the value of time ... is an essential preliminary to efficient work; it is the only method of avoiding hurry.

It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.
"One hour of life, crowded to the full with glorious action and filled with noble risks, is worth whole years of those mean observances of paltry decorum."

"Have a time and place for everything, and do everything in its time and place, and you will not only accomplish more, but have far more leisure than those who are always hurrying."
"It is not how many years we live, but rather what we do with them."
"During a very busy life I have often been asked, ""How did you manage to it all?"" The answer is very simple: it is because I did everything promptly."
"Time cannot be expanded, accumulated, mortgaged, hastened, or retarded."
Seize time by the forelock.
Time is a tyranny to be abolished.
"The time which we have at our disposal every day is elastic; the passions that we feel expand it, those that we inspire contract it; and habit fills up the rest."
The ability to concentrate and to use time well is everything.
"Time is an equal opportunity employer. Each human being has exactly the same number of hours and minutes every day. Rich people can't buy more hours. Scientists can't invent new minutes. And you can't save time to spend it on another day. Even so, time is amazingly fair and forgiving. No matter how much time you've wasted in the past, you still have an entire tomorrow. Success depends upon using it wisely-by planning and setting priorities."
"An Italian philosopher said that ""time was his estate""; an estate indeed which will produce nothing without cultivation, but will always abundantly repay the labors of industry, and generally satisfy the most extensive desires, if no part of it be suffered to lie in waste by negligence, to be overrun with noxious plants, or laid out for show rather than for use."
"Timely service, like timely gifts, is doubled in value."

He who would make serious use of his life must always act as though he had a long time to live and schedule his time as though he were about to die.
The highest value in life is found in the stewardship of time.
A stale mind is the devil's breadbox.
"I wish I could stand on a busy corner, hat in hand, and beg people to throw me all their wasted hours."
"Every day I live I am more convinced that the waste of life lies in the love we have not given, the powers we have not used, the selfish prudence that will risk nothing and which, shirking pain, misses happiness as well."
Wasted time means wasted lives.
"Regret for time wasted can become a power for good in the time that remains, if we will only stop the waste and the idle, useless regretting."
Economy is the thief of time.
"I wasted time, and now doth time waste me."
All that time is lost which might be better employed.
"Lost, yesterday, somewhere between sunrise and sunset, two golden hours, each set with sixty diamond minutes. No reward is offered, for they are gone forever."
"Thrift of time will repay you in afterlife, with a usury of profit beyond your most sanguine dreams; waste of it will make you dwindle, alike in intellectual and moral stature, beyond your darkest reckoning."
The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.
"Time is lost when we have not lived a full human life, time unenriched by experience, creative endeavor, enjoyment, and suffering."
"Still on it creeps, Each little moment at another's heels, Till hours, days, years, and ages are made up Of such small parts as these, and men look back Worn and bewilder'd, wondering how it is."
"Does't thou love life? Then do not squander time, for that is the stuff life is made of."
Time wasted is a theft from God.
Lost time is like a run in a stocking. It always gets worse.
As if you could kill time without injuring eternity.
Killing time is the chief end of our society.
"You can kill time or kill yourself, it comes to the same thing in the end."
No person will have occasion to complain of the want of time who never loses any.
"Time is that which man is always trying to kill, but which ends in killing him."
"Do not wait for leaders; do it alone, person to person."
"Men talk of killing time, while time quietly kills them."
Modern man thinks he loses something-time-when he does not do things quickly. Yet he does not know what to do with the time he gains- except kill it.
"If you want to kill time, try working it to death."
A man who dares to waste one hour of life has not discovered the value of life.
"If time be of all things most precious, wasting time must be the greatest prodigality, since lost time is never found again."
Don't agonize. Organize.
Curse ruthless time! Curse our mortality. How cruelly short is the allotted span for all we must cram into it!
Death and taxes and childbirth! There's never any convenient time for any of them!
There is a time for work. And a time for love. That leaves no other time.
"You will never ""find"" time for anything. If you want time you must make it."
We have as much time as we need.
Ah! the clock is always slow; it is later than you think.
The forty-four-hour week has no charm for me. I'm looking for a forty-hour day.
Those who make the worst use of their time most complain of its brevity.
"I still find each day too short for all the thoughts I want to think, all the walks I want to take, all the books I want to read, and all the friends I want to see."
What we love to do we find time to do.
Time stays long enough for anyone who will use it.
There is time for everything.
It is nonsense to say there is not enough time to be fully informed. ... Time given to thought is the greatest timesaver of all.
We all find time to do what we really want to do.
"Time is a fixed income and, as with any income, the real problem facing most of us is how to live successfully within our daily allotment."
"We shall never have more time. We have, and have always had, all the time there is. No object is served in waiting until next week or even until to-morrow. Keep going. ... Concentrate on something useful."
There is time enough for everything in the course of the day if you do but one thing at once; but there is not time enough in the year if you will do two things at a time.
"Much may be done in those little shreds and patches of time which every day produces, and which most men throw away."
Learn to use ten minutes intelligently. It will pay you huge dividends.
It is better to do the most trifling thing in the world than to regard half an hour as trifle.
"I recommend you to take care of the minutes, for the hours will take care of themselves."
"The real secret of how to use time is to pack it as you would a portmanteau, filling up the small spaces with small things."
"One must learn a different... sense of time, one that depends more on small amounts than big ones."
"An earnest purpose finds time, or makes it. It seizes on spare moments, and turns fragments to golden account."
Guard well your spare moments. They are like uncut diamonds. Discard them and their value will never be known. Improve them and they will become the brightest gems in a useful life.
"The butterfly counts not months but moments, and has time enough."
"That man is happiest who lives from day to day and asks no more, garnering the simple goodness of life."
It is only possible to live happily-ever-after on a day-to-day basis.
"Happiness is produced not so much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen, as by little advantages that occur every day."
All the great blessings of my life are present in my thoughts today.
The best way to secure future happiness is to be as happy as is rightfully possible today.
"A fool bolts pleasure, then complains of indigestion."
"Happiness is to be found along the way, not at the end of the road, for then the journey is over and it is too late. Today, this hour, this minute is the day, the hour, the minute for each of us to sense the fact that life is good, with all of its trials and troubles, and perhaps more interesting because of them."
Each day provides its own gifts.
Let us savour the swift delights of the most beautiful of our days!
"Death accompanies us at every step and enables us to use those moments when life smiles at us to feel more deeply the sweetness of life. The more certain the end, the more tempting the minute."
"Happiness is not a state to arrive at, but a manner of traveling."
"My advice to you is not to inquire why or whither, but just to enjoy your ice cream while it's on your plate."
"Those who face that which is actually before them, unburdened by the past, undistracted by the future, these are they who live, who make the best use of their lives; these are those who have found the secret of contentment."
"And that was victory. The freedom to sprawl loosely upon a city street, heat his coffee and eat a can of beans ... with no enemy bullets forcing him to toss the can aside while diving behind another wall for momentary survival."
"Taking time to live is taking time to appreciate simple silence as better than any kind of talk, or watching a flower, or watching a guy wash the windows on a skyscraper and wondering what he is thinking."
"If you observe a really happy man, you will find ... that he is happy in tiie course of living life twenty-four crowded hours each day."
"To fill the hour, that is happiness; to fill the hour, and leave no crevice for a repentance or an approval."
"Live your life each day as you would climb a mountain. An occasional glance toward the summit keeps the goal in mind, but many beautiful scenes are to be observed from each new vantage point. Climb slowly, steadily, enjoying each passing moment; and the view from the summit will serve as a fitting climax for the journey."
One day of pleasure is worth two of sorrow.
Present joys are more to flesh and blood Than the dull prospect of a distant good.
"In order to be utterly happy the only thing necessary is to refrain from comparing this moment with other moments in the past, which I often did not fully enjoy because I was comparing them with other moments of the future."
Live in day-tight compartments.
"If you are not happy here and now, you never will be."
People who postpone happiness are like children who try chasing rainbows in an effort to find the pot of gold at the rainbow's end. ... Your life will never be fulfilled until you are happy here and now.

"Today is the day in which to express your noblest qualities of mind and heart, to do at least one worthy thing which you have long postponed."
"Do what you can, with what you have, where you are."
Our grand business undoubtedly is not to see what lies dimly at a distance but to do what lies clearly at hand.
My formula for living is quite simple. I get up in the morning and I go to bed at night. In between I occupy myself as best I can.
What you are afraid to do is a clear indicator of the next thing you need to do.
"If we cannot meet our everyday surroundings with equanimity and pleasure and grow each day in some useful direction, then ... life is on the road toward misfortune, misery and destruction."
"A day's work is a day's work, neither more nor less, and the man who does it needs a day's sustenance, a night's repose and due leisure, whether he be painter or ploughman."
Add each day something to fortify you against poverty and death.
It isn't hard to be good from time to time in sports. What's tough is being good every day.
Make it a point to do something every day that you don't want to do. This is the golden rule for acquiring the habit of doing your duty without pain.
Realize life as an end in itself. Functioning is all there is.
He has not learned the first lesson of life who does not every day surmount a fear.
A homer a day will boost my pay.
"Act well at the moment, and you have performed a good action to all eternity."
"If I had my life to live over, I would start barefoot earlier in the spring and stay that way later in the fall. I would go to more dances. I would ride more merry-go-rounds. I would pick more daisies."
Nothing determines who we will become so much as those things we choose to ignore.
"Love, and do what you like."
Take the time to come home to yourself everyday.
"The power of a man's virtue should not be measured by his special efforts, but by his ordinary doing."

Follow your bliss. -Joseph Campbell Resolve to perform what you ought. Perform without fail what you resolve.
"Resolve to edge in a little reading every day, if it is but a single sentence. If you gain fifteen minutes a day, it will make itself felt at the end of the year."
"I work every day-or at least I force myself into my office or room. I may get nothing done, but you don't earn bonuses without putting in time. Nothing may come for three months, but you don't get the fourth without it."
"Take short views, hope for the best, and trust in God."
Each day can be one of triumph if you keep up your interests.
"When action grows unprofitable, gather information; when information grows unprofitable, sleep."
"I long to accomplish a great and noble task, but it is my chief duty to accomplish small tasks as if they were great and noble."

Showing up is 80 percent of life.
"Do you know that disease and death must needs overtake us, no matter what we are doing? ... What do you wish to be doing when it overtakes you? If you have anything better to be doing when you are so overtaken, get to work on that."
"Have patience with all things, but chiefly have patience with yourself. Do not lose courage in considering your own imperfections, but instantly set about remedying them-every day begin the task anew."

"To look up and not down, To look forward and not back, To look out and not in, and To lend a hand."
"Do all the good you can, By all the means you can, In all the ways you can, In all the places you can, At all the times you can."
"I like the man who faces what he must, With steps triumphant and a heart of cheer; Who fights the daily battle without fear."
To accomplish our destiny ... we must cover before nightfall the distance assigned to each of us.
Each day should be passed as though it were our last.
Learn as if you were going to live forever. Live as if you were going to die tomorrow.
One should count each day a separate life.
"If, every day, I dare to remember that I am here on loan, that this house, this hillside, these minutes are all leased to me, not given, I will never despair."
"To live each day as though one's last, never flustered, never apathetic, never attitudinizing-here is perfection of character."
Look at everything as though you were seeing it for the first time or the last time. Then your time on earth will be filled with glory.
"The years seem to rush by now, and I think of death as a fast approaching end of a journey-double and treble reason for loving as well as working while it is day."
Study as if you were going to live forever; live as if you were going to die tomorrow.
Every day is a little life ... live every day as if it would be the last. Those that dare lose a day are dangerously prodigal; those that dare misspend it are desperate.
"You have to count on living every single day in a way you believe will make you feel good about your life- so that if it were over tomorrow, you'd be content with yourself."
No one can confidently say that he will still be living tomorrow.
"Happy the man, and happy he alone He who can call today his own He who, secure within, can say ""Tomorrow, do thy worst For I have lived today."""
Do your best every day and your life will gradually expand into satisfying fullness.
"There are only three colors, ten digits, and seven notes; it's what we do with them that's important."
Any man's life will be filled with constant and unexpected encouragement if he makes up his mind to do his level best each day.
Do each daily task the best we can; act as though the eye of opportunity were always upon us.
"What a man accomplishes in a day depends upon the way in which he approaches his tasks. When we accept tough jobs as a challenge to our ability and wade into them with joy and enthusiasm, miracles can happen."
"Look at a day when you are supremely satisfied at the end. It's not a day when you lounge around doing nothing; it's when you've had everything to do, and you've done it."
So get a few laughs and do the best you can.
"I come to the office each morning and stay for long hours doing what has to be done to the best of my ability. And when you've done the best you can, you can't do any better. So when I go to sleep I turn everything over to the Lord and forget it."
That man is blest who does his best and leaves the rest.
"When you rise in the morning, form a resolution to make the day a happy one for a fellow creature."
"He who allows his day to pass by without practicing generosity and enjoying life's pleasures is like a blacksmith's bellows; he breathes, but does not live."

Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity.
The most thoroughly wasted of all days is that on which one has not laughed.
"Each day, and the living of it, has to be a conscious creation in which discipline and order are relieved with some play and pure foolishness."
Sweets are good for the nerves.
Fat gives things flavor.
"Friends, I beg you do not shirk your daily task of indolence."
"If someone said, ""Write a sentence about your life,"" I'd write, ""I want to go outside and play."""
We should consider every day lost on which we have not danced at least once.
Life is about enjoying yourself and having a good time.
Put a little fun into your life. Try dancing.
He who does not get fun and enjoyment out of every day ... needs to reorganize his life.
"Unless each day can be looked back upon by an individual as one in which he has had some fun, some joy, some real satisfaction, that day is a loss."
Take time every day to do something silly.
It's fun to get together and have something good to eat at least once a day. That's what human life is all about-enjoying things.
"Come, let us give a little time to folly ... and even in a melancholy day let us find time for an hour of pleasure."
"No matter what looms ahead, if you can eat today, enjoy the sunlight today, mix good cheer with friends today, enjoy it and bless God for it."
"Be Satisfied with a Good Day's Work There are hundreds of tasks we feel we must accomplish in the day, but if we do not take them one at a time ... we are bound to break our own physical or mental structure."
A man can do only what he can do. But if he does that each day he can sleep at night and do it again the next day.
"If I had my life to live over, I would start barefoot earlier in the spring and stay that way later in the fall. I would go to more dances. I would ride more merry-go-rounds. I would pick more daisies."
I finally figured out the only reason to be alive is to enjoy it.
"We cannot do everything at once, but we can do something at once."
Always do one thing less than you think you can do.
"I come to the office each morning and stay for long hours doing what has to be done to the best of my ability. And when you've done the best you can, you can't do any better. So when I go to sleep I turn everything over to the Lord and forget it."
"A day's work is a day's work, neither more nor less, and the man who does it needs a day's sustenance, a night's repose and due leisure, whether he be painter or ploughman."
Sufficient to each day are the duties to be done and the trials to be endured.
"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith."
"I look back on my life like a good day's work; it is done, and I am satisfied with it."
The moment we pass out of our habits we lose all sense of permanency and routine.
"Manners are a sensitive awareness of the feelings of others. If you have that awareness, you have good manners, no matter what fork you use."
And hearts have been broken from harsh words spoken That sorrow can ne'er set right.
That which is horrifying to you don't do to anybody else.
It is too bad if you have to do everything upon reflection and can't do anything from early habit.
"Most of life is routine-dull and grubby, but routine is the mountain that keeps a man going. If you wait for inspiration you'll be standing on the corner after the parade is a mile down the street."
"Good habits, which bring our lower passions and appetites under automatic control, leave our natures free to explore the larger experiences of life."
"Without the aid of prejudice and custom, I should not be able to find my way across the room."
Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going.
"Habits are safer than rules; you don't have to watch them. And you don't have to keep them, either; they keep you."
"Habit is not mere subjugation, it is a tender tie; when one remembers habit it seems to have been happiness."
"To learn new habits is everything, for it is to reach the substance of life. Life is but a tissue of habits."
"Choose always the way that seems the best, however rough it may be; custom will soon render it easy and agreeable."
Quality is not an act. It is a habit.
It is not in novelty but in habit that we find the greatest pleasure.
Habit is stronger than reason.
Character is simply habit long enough continued.
Nothing is more powerful than habit.
"If you do the same thing every day at the same time for the same length of time, you'll save yourself from many a sink. Routine is a condition of survival."
"Have a time and place for everything, and do everything in its time and place, and you will not only accomplish more, but have far more leisure than those who are always hurrying."
"Anyone can carry his burden, however hard, until nightfall. Anyone can do his work, however hard, for one day. Anyone can live sweetly, patiently, lovingly, purely, till the sun goes down. And this is all life really means."
"Come what may, time and the hour runs through the roughest day."
"At any rate, you can bear it for a quarter of an hour!"
The longest day is soon ended.
The secret of my success is that I always managed to live to fly another day.
"The time which we have at our disposal every day is elastic; the passions that we feel expand it, those that we inspire contract it; and habit fills up what remains."
A day is a miniature eternity.
"One day, with life and heart, is more than time enough to find a world."
A day is a span of time no one is wealthy enough to waste.
"When a man sits with a pretty girl for an hour, it seems like a minute. But let him sit on a hot stove for a minute, and it's longer than any hour. That's relativity."
"Too slow for those who wait, Too swift for those who fear, Too long for those who grieve, Too short for those who rejoice. But for those who love, time is not."
"The less one has to do, the less time one finds to do it in. One yawns, one procrastinates, one can do it when one will, and, therefore, one seldom does it at all; whereas those who have a great deal of business must buckle to it; and then they always find time enough to do it."
Time is nothing absolute; its duration depends on the rate of thought and feeling.
Time is a fluid condition which has no existence except in the momentary avatars of individual people.
"What then is time? If no one asks me, I know what it is. If I wish to explain it to him who asks, I do not know."
"Time is the product of changing realities, beings, existences."
Time is the arbitrary division of eternity.
"Time is a part of eternity, and of the same piece with it."
Each day is a little life; every waking and rising a little birth; every fresh morning a little youth; every going to rest and sleep a little death.
Time is eternity begun.
"Time is not a line, but a series of now-points."
"You can't measure time in days the way you can money in dollars, because each day is different."
An hour of pain is as long as a day of pleasure.
"The value of life lies not in the length of days, but in the use we make of them; a man may live long yet live very little."
"Reality is a staircase going neither up nor down, we don't move; today is today, always is today."

My father gave me these hints on speech making: Be sincere ... be brief ... be seated.
"A good speech, like a woman's skirt, should be long enough to cover the subject and short enough to create interest. I have been asked to give my address in the remaining five minutes. That I can do! Here it is: 10 Carlton Gardens, London, England."
I sort of feel like Cindy Crawford's new husband on their wedding night. I know what's expected of me. I'm just not sure I've got the ability to make it interesting.

"I don't want to be patronizing . . . that means ""talking down."""
speaker: I have only ten minutes and hardly know where to begin. voice in back: Begin at the ninth.
"After such an introduction, I can hardly wait to hear what I'm going to say."
"I was chosen to speak due to my warm personality. . . . Look up warm and it means ""not so hot."""
"A speech that's full of sparkling wit will keep its hearer grinning, provided its end is close to its beginning."

The foolish and the dead alone never change their opinions.

Every man is the architect of his own fortune.
He that waits upon fortune is never sure of a dinner.
There is no security on this earth. Only opportunity.
Too many people are thinking of security instead of opportunity; they seem more afraid of life than of death.
"Freedom is nothing else but a chance to be better, whereas enslavement is a certainty of the worst."
The opportunity is often lost by deliberating.
I have always been waiting for something better-sometimes to see the best I had snatched from me.
"The sad truth is that opportunity doesn't knock twice. You can put things off until tomorrow but tomorrow may never come. Where will you be a few years down the line? Will it be everything you dreamed of? We seal our fate with the choices we take, but don't give a second thought to the chances we take."
"You decide you'll wait for your pitch. Then as the ball starts toward the plate, you think about your stance. And then you think about your swing. And then you realize that the ball that went past you for a strike was your pitch."
Small opportunities are often the beginning of great enterprises.
Any ritual is an opportunity for transformation.
Ability is of little account without opportunity.
Our opportunities to do good are our talents.
"Opportunity knocks at every man's door once. On some men's door it hammers till it breaks down the door and then it goes in and wakes him up if he's asleep, and ever afterward it works for him as a night watchman."
It is less important to redistribute wealth than it is to redistribute opportunity.
You can't make souffle rise twice.
"A door that seems to stand open must be a man's size, or it is not the door that Providence means for him."
"Next to knowing when to seize an opportunity, the most important thing in life is to know when to forgo an advantage."
The follies which a man regrets most in his life are those which he didn't commit when he had the opportunity.
To see a shadow and think it is a tree-that is a pity; but to see a tree and to think it a shadow can be fatal.
"Great opportunities come to all, but many do not know they have met them. The only preparation to take advantage of them is simple fidelity to watch what each day brings."
Opportunities are everywhere.
"Opportunities are usually disguised as hard work, so most people don't recognize them."
"The world is all gates, all opportunities, strings of tension waiting to be struck."
No great man ever complains of want of opportunity.
"Great opportunities to help others seldom come, but small ones come daily."
"Men do with opportunities as children do at the seashore; they fill their little hands with sand, and then let the grains fall through, one by one, till all are gone."
"Do not wait for ideal circumstances, nor for the best opportunities; they will never come."
Nothing is so often irretrievably missed as a daily opportunity.
"If a man looks sharply and attentively, he shall see fortune; for though she be blind, yet she is not invisible."
Know thine opportunity.
In great affairs we ought to apply ourselves less to creating chances than to profiting from those that are offered.
Opportunity is as scarce as oxygen; men fairly breathe it and do not know it.
"Opportunities do not come with their values stamped upon them. ... To face every opportunity of life thoughtfully, and ask its meaning bravely and earnestly, is the only way to meet supreme opportunities when they come, whether open-faced or disguised."
"We are told that talent creates its own opportunities. But it sometimes seems that intense desire creates not only its own opportunities, but its own talents."
How many opportunities present themselves to a man without his noticing them?
"Luck affects everything. Let your hook be always cast. In the stream where you least expect it, there will be a fish."
The opportunity that God sends does not wake up him who is asleep.
"Present opportunities are neglected, and attainable good is slighted, by minds busied in extensive ranges and intent upon future advantages."
Opportunities multiply as they are seized; they die when neglected. Life is a long line of opportunities.
It is often hard to distinguish between the hard knocks in life and those of opportunity.
"I think luck is the sense to recognize an opportunity and the ability to take advantage of it. Everyone has bad breaks, but everyone also has opportunities. The man who can smile at his breaks and grab his chances gets on."
"To improve the golden moment of opportunity, and catch the good that is within our reach, is the great art of life."
"The greatest achievement of the human spirit is to live up to one's opportunities, and make the most of one's resources."
"When one door closes, another opens. But we often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door that we do not see the one which has opened for us."
"The opportunities for enjoyment in your life are limitless. If you feel you are not experiencing enough joy, you have only yourself to blame."
Opportunities are often things you haven't noticed the first time around.
The successful man is one who had the chance and took it.
Vigilance in watching opportunity; tact and daring in seizing upon opportunity; force and persistence in crowding opportunity to its utmost possible achievement-these are the martial virtues which must command success.
To avoid an occasion for our virtues is a worse degree of failure than to push forward pluckily and make a fall.
Opportunity knocks but once.
I was seldom able to see an opportunity until it had ceased to be one.
"If Fortune calls, offer him a seat."
"What the student calls a tragedy, the master calls a butterfly."
"Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls, and looks like work."
Times of stress and difficulty are seasons of opportunity when the seeds of progress are sown.
We must look for the opportunity in every difficulty instead of being paralyzed at the thought of the difficulty in every opportunity.
The best impromptu speeches are the ones written well in advance.
"Opportunity can benefit no man who has not fitted himself to seize it and use it. Opportunity woos the worthy, shuns the unworthy. Prepare yourself to grasp opportunity, and opportunity is likely to come your way. It is not so fickle, capricious and unreasoning as some complain."
Opportunity rarely knocks until you are ready. And few people have ever been really ready without receiving opportunity's call.
The secret to success in life is for a man to be ready for his opportunity when it comes.
I always keep myself in a position of being a student.
I think the young actor who really wants to act will find a way ... to keep at it and seize every opportunity that comes along.
"If you want greater prosperity in your life, start forming a vacuum to receive it."
"Unless a man has trained himself for his chance, the chance will only make him ridiculous."
Do not suppose opportunity will knock twice at your door.
Make hay while the sun shines.
Plough deep while sluggards sleep.
"There is a tide in the affairs of men, Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune."
"The opportunity for doing mischief is found a hundred times a day, and of doing good once in a year."
"In the midst of winter, I finally learned that there was in me an invincible summer."
One cloud is enough to eclipse all the sun.
The progress of rivers to the ocean is not so rapid as that of man to error.
"When I look in the glass I see that every line in my face means pessimism, but in spite of my face - that is my experience - I remain an optimist."
An optimist is a guy that has never had much experience.
An optimist is a fellow who believes what's going to be will be postponed.
"Pessimist - one who, when he has the choice of two evils, chooses both."
My pessimism goes to the point of suspecting the sincerity of the pessimists.
A pessimist is one who has been compelled to live with an optimist.
Pessimism is only the name that men of weak nerves give to wisdom.
"When it is dark enough, you can see the stars."
There is not enough darkness in all the world to put out the light of even one small candle.
"When things come to the worst, they generally mend."
"The optimist claims we live in the best of all possible worlds, and the pessimist fears this is true."
"Still round the corner there may wait, a new road, or a secret gate."
"When Fortune empties her chamberpot on your head, smile and say 'We are going to have a summer shower.'"
The world gets better every day - then worse again in the evening.
A man he seems of cheerful yesterdays And confident tomorrows.
There is a budding morrow in midnight.
Optimism: A cheerful frame of mind that enables a tea kettle to sing though in hot water up to its nose.
An optimist sees an opportunity in every calamity; a pessimist sees a calamity in every opportunity.
"To look up and not down, To look forward and not back, To look out and not in, and To lend a hand."
"Two men look out through the same bars: One sees the mud, and one the stars."
Keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see the shadow.
Oratory is the power to talk people out of their sober and natural opinions.
Glittering generalities! They are blazing ubiquities.
I am not fond of uttering platitudes In stained-glass attitudes.
"The object of oratory is not truth, but persuasion."
"What the orators want in depth, they give you in length."
It is much safer to obey than to rule.
Let all things be done decently and in order.
"There is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere, anytime."
"When liberty destroys order, the hunger for order will destroy liberty."
Those who are fond of setting things to rights have no great objection to setting them wrong.
To have his path made clear for him is the aspiration of every human being in our beclouded and tempestuous existence.
Our laws make law impossible; our liberties destroy all freedom; our property is organized robbery; our morality an impudent hypocrisy; our wisdom is administered by inexperienced or mal-experienced dupes; our power wielded by cowards and weaklings; and our honour false in all its points. I am an enemy of the existing order for good reasons.
Crude classifications and false generalizations are the curse of organized life.
"Timing, degree and conviction are the three wise men in this life."
"We put things in order - God does the rest. Lay an iron bar east and west, it is not magnetized. Lay it north and south and it is."
"I must create a system, or be enslaved by another man's."
Out of intense complexities intense simplicities emerge.
"There is no course of life so weak and sottish as that which is managed by order, method and discipline."
"Large organization is loose organization. Nay, it would be almost as true to say that organization is always disorganization."
"That's what learning is. You suddenly understand something you understood all your life, but in a new way."
Have a place for everything and have everything in its place.
Set thine house in order.
Order is Heaven's first law.
Originality is the art of concealing your sources.
"Utter originality is, of course, out of the question."
We do not inherit this land from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children.
"Why can't somebody give us a list of things that everybody thinks and nobody says, and another list of things that everybody says and nobody thinks."
"Originality is nothing but judicious imitation. The most original writers borrowed one from another. The instruction we find in books is like fire. We fetch it from our neighbours, kindle it at home, communicate it to others and it becomes the property of all."
"Originality does not consist in saying what no one has ever said before, but in saying exactly what you think yourself."
"What a good thing Adam had - when he said a good thing, he knew nobody had said it before."
All cases are unique and very similar to others.
I invent nothing. I rediscover.
There is nothing new under the sun.
"When people are free to do as they please, they usually imitate each other. Originality is deliberate and forced, and partakes of the nature of a protest."
All profoundly original work looks ugly at first.
Riding hard for glory.
What is originality? Undetected plagiarism.
"The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves."
You always admire what you really don't understand.
What you can't get is just what suits you.
"The dream is real, my friends. The failure to realize it is the only reality."
The true exercise of freedom is-can-nily and wisely and with grace-to move inside what space confines-and not seek to know what lies beyond and cannot be touched or tasted.
Death and taxes and childbirth! There's never any convenient time for any of them!
No one is content with his own lot.
"Let us accept truth, even when it surprises us and alters our views."
To have ideals is not the same as to have impracticable ideals.
There has never been an age that did not applaud the past and lament the present.
"Every stage of life has its troubles, and no man is content with his own age."
"We love in others what we lack ourselves, and would be everything but what we are."
There is less in this than meets the eye.
"When you don't have any money, the problem is food. When you have money, it's sex. When you have both, it's health. If everything is simply jake, then you're frightened of death."
"Diogenes was asked what wine he liked best, and he answered, ""Somebody else's."""
The apples on the other side of the wall are the sweetest.
Nothing is so good as it seems beforehand.
"Happiness is ... usually attributed by adults to children, and by children to adults."
Acorns were good till bread was found.
None of us is ever satisfied with what we are.
"We always long for forbidden things, k and desire what is denied us."
Man's heart is never satisfied; the snake would swallow the elephant.
We all envy other people's luck.
"When every blessed thing you have is made of silver, or of gold, you long for simple pewter."
"I'd rather have written ""Cheers"" than anything I've written."
"When a man's busy, leisure strikes him as a wonderful pleasure; and at leisure once is he? Straightway he wants to be busy."
To most of us the real life is the life we do not lead.
Happiness to a dog is what lies on the other side of the door.
Man would be otherwise. That is the essence of the specifically human.
He who would be happy should stay at home.
He who leaves his house in search of happiness pursues a shadow.
It is not irritating to be where one is. It is only irritating to think one would like to be somewhere else.
"Pioneers may be picturesque figures, but they are often rather lonely ones."
He that is discontented in one place will seldom be happy in another.
We are under the spell always of what is distant from us. It is not in our nature to desire passionately what is near at hand.
"In all climates, under all skies, man's happiness is always somewhere else."
In Rome you long for the country. In the country you praise to the skies the distant town.
He who would be happy should stay at home.
"Life is a hospital in which every patient is possessed by the desire of changing his bed. One would prefer to suffer near the fire, and another is certain he would get well if he were by the window."
It is common to overlook what is near by keeping the eye fixed on something remote.
"There are three wants which can never be satisfied: that of the rich, who want something more; that of the sick, who want something different; and that of the traveler, who says, ""Anywhere but here."""
"Happiness grows at our firesides, and is not to be picked in strangers' gardens."
"Men run away to other countries because they are not good in their own, and run back to their own because they pass for nothing in the new places."
The proper means of increasing the love we bear our native country is to reside some time in a foreign one.
"If solid happiness we prize, within our breast this jewel lies, And they are fools who roam; the world has nothing to bestow, From our own selves our bliss must flow, And that dear hut-our home."
A child on a farm sees a plane fly overhead and dreams of a faraway place. A traveler on the plane sees the farmhouse and dreams of home.
"Life has no smooth road for any of us; and in the bracing atmosphere of a high aim the very roughness stimulates the climber to steadier steps till the legend, ""over steep ways to the stars,"" fulfills itself."
The only normal people are the ones you don't know very well.
"Before we set our hearts too much upon anything, let us examine how happy they are who already possess it."
What makes us discontented with our condition is the absurdly exaggerated idea we have of the happiness of others.
Nobody's problem is ideal. Nobody has things just as he would like them.
Everybody in the world ought to be sorry for everybody else. We all have our little private hell.
"We are convinced that happiness is never to be found, and each believes it possessed by others, to keep alive the hope of obtaining it for himself."
Men would be angels; angels would be gods.
None think the great unhappy but the great.
"If every man's internal care Were written on his brow, How many would our pity share Who raise our envy now?"
Misfortunes come to all men.
You have no idea how big the other fellow's troubles are.
"I have been very happy, very rich, very beautiful, much adulated, very famous and very unhappy."
"I feel successful when the writing goes well. This lasts five minutes. Once, when I was on the bestseller list, I also felt successful. That lasted three minutes."
Great and small suffer the same mishaps.
I thought I had reached a point in life where everything would be smooth. But it is not. It just gets more jagged and pitted and filled with turns that take you into the dark recesses of your mind. It never seems to get easy.
"If I were given a change of life, I'd like to see how it would be to live as a mere six-footer."
I just want to be an ordinary girl.
"Money is another pressure. I'm not complaining, I'm just saying that there's a certain luxury in having no money. I spent ten years in New York not having it, not worrying about it. Suddenly you have it, then you worry, where is it going? Am I doing the right thing with it?"
"On the outside one is a star. But in reality, one is completely alone, doubting everything. To experience this loneliness of soul is the hardest thing in the world."
"There is no man in this world without some manner of tribulation or anguish, though he be king or pope."
The only incurable troubles of the rich are the troubles that money can't cure.
There is no man in any rank who is always at liberty to act as he would incline; in some quarter or other he is limited by circumstances.
None of us can be free of conflict and woe. Even the greatest men have had to accept disappointments as their daily bread. ... The art of living lies less in eliminating our troubles than in growing with them.
Renown is a source of toil and sorrow; obscurity is a source of happiness.
My crown is called content; a crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.
"If I had my life to live over, I wish I could be a great pianist or something."
There is no armour against fate; death lays his icy hands on kings.
Pale death with impartial tread beats at the poor man's cottage door and at the palaces of kings.
"I want to be able to live without a crowded calendar. I want to be able to read a book without feeling guilty, or go to a concert when I like."
I'd like to be a truck driver. I think you could run your life that way. It wouldn't be such a bad way of doing it. It would offer a chance to be alone.
There is as much confusion in the world of the gods as in ours.
Pray the gods do not envy your happiness!
The suffering of the rich is among the sweetest pleasures of the poor.
"Oh God, don't envy me, I have my own pains."
Success is counted sweetest by those who never succeed.
"I have known no man of genius who had not to pay, in some affliction or defect either physical or spiritual, for what the gods had given him."
"I have been very happy, very rich, very beautiful, much adulated, very famous and very unhappy."
"I feel successful when the writing goes well. This lasts five minutes. Once, when I was on the bestseller list, I also felt successful. That lasted three minutes."
Men are all the same. They always think that something they are going to get is better than what they have got.
Not all speed is movement.
"Success is not greedy, as people think, but insignificant. That's why it satisfies nobody."
"Oh, I wish that God had not given me what I prayed for! It was not so good as I thought."
"Beggars do not envy millionaires, though of course they will envy other beggars who are more successful."
"Ambition, having reached the summit, longs to descend."
What we call progress is the exchange of one nuisance for another nuisance.
"The superpowers often behave like two heavily armed blind men feeling their way around a room, each believing himself in mortal peril from the other, who he assumes to have perfect vision."
"Wanting to change, to improve, a person's situation means offering him, for difficulties in which he is practiced and experienced, other difficulties that will find him perhaps even more bewildered."
Being considered beautiful at a young age sends confusing signals. You think people only like you because of your beauty.
Youth is not a question of years: one is young or old from birth.
"When I was fourteen, I was the oldest I ever was. ... I've been getting younger ever since."
"A child's world is fresh and new and beautiful, full of wonder and excitement. It is our misfortune that for most of us that clear-eyed vision, that true instinct for what is beautiful and awe-inspiring, is dimmed and even lost before we reach adulthood."
"Sure, I'm for helping the elderly. I'm going to be old myself someday."
Youth is something very new: twenty years ago no one mentioned it.
"A comfortable old age is the reward of a well-spent youth. Instead of its bringing sad and melancholy prospects of decay, it would give us hopes of eternal youth in a better world."
"We turn not older with years, but newer every day."
Old age is when the liver spots show through your gloves.
"The middle years, caught between children and parents, free of neither: the past stretches back too densely, it is too thickly populated, the future has not yet thinned out."
"It is not how old you are, but how you are old."
One of the many things nobody ever tells you about middle age is that it's such a nice change from being young.
"When you become 100, life changes completely."
"This is a youth-oriented society, and the joke is on them because youth is a disease from which we all recover."
"Old age, believe me, is a good and pleasant thing. It is true you are gently shouldered off the stage, but then you are given such a comfortable front stall as spectator."
I look forward to growing old and wise and audacious.
"It is so comical to hear oneself called old, even at ninety I suppose!"
I enjoy my wrinkles and regard them as badges of distinction-I've worked hard for them!
"Time-our youth-it never really goes, does it? It is all held in our minds."
Even I don't wake up looking like Cindy Crawford.
"We all lose our looks eventually, better develop your character and interest in life."
The lovely thing about being forty is that you can appreciate twenty-five-year-old men more.
The only thing that makes one place more attractive to me than another is the quantity of heart I find in it.
"A woman may develop wrinkles and cellulite, lose her waistline, her bust-line, her ability to bear a child, even her sense of humor, but none of that implies a loss of her sexuality, her femininity."
Old age is like a plane flying through a storm. Once you are aboard there is nothing you can do.
In youth the days are short and the years are long. In old age the years are short and day's long.
How long can you be cute?
Being pretty on the inside means you don't hit your brother and you eat all your peas-that's what my grandma taught me.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
"When you're fifty, you start thinking about things you haven't thought about before. I used to think getting old was about vanity-but actually it's about losing people you love. Getting wrinkles is trivial."
I am desperate and vulnerable. ... I am always terrified.... Beauty can sometimes be so very troublesome.
I hate myself on the screen. I want to die ... my voice is either too high or too gravelly. I want to dive under the carpet.... I'd love to be tall and willowy ... I'm short.
"After a certain number of years, our faces become our biographies."
"I don't like my voice. I don't like the way I look. I don't like the way I move. I don't like the way I act. I mean, period. So, you know, I don't like myself."
Not always the fanciest cake that's there Is the best to eat!
"No, Doctor, I don't want to grow young again. I just want to keep on growing old."
"It is quite wrong to think of old age as a downward slope. On the contrary, one climbs higher and higher with the advancing years, and that, too, with surprising strides."
"I look forward to being older, when what you look like becomes less and less an issue and what you are is the i point."
"When you've got the personality, you don't need the nudity."
"The only real elegance is in the mind; if you've got that, the rest really comes from it."
"Beauty can get a woman what she wants: love and money. But when beauty leaves you, so can the things it brought."
"If you're considered a beauty, it's hard to be accepted doing anything but standing around."
"Just because you're beautiful, they think you can't act.... I've got a lot more to prove."
"I intimidate men.... People look a lot, but there's no line outside my door."
"People see you as an object, not as a person, and they project a set of expectations onto you. People who don't have it think beauty is a blessing, but actually it sets you apart."
"I can count the number of dates I've had on one hand. I wish that guys would approach me, but they don't."
When you step on the first tee it doesn't matter what you look like. ... It doesn't help your 5-iron if you're pretty.
For years I stopped reading beauty magazines because I couldn't look at one without wanting to blow my brains out. How can those women look so good?
"Each time I get off a plane in Hollywood, I don't think I'm pretty enough."
"Frankly, I like the fact that I no longer fit the young beauty type-people take me more seriously now."
You know how many stunning women told me they can't stand a good-looking man? ... Women feel secure with an ugly guy because a man in bad shape isn't gonna cheat.
"Outstanding beauty, like outstanding gifts of any kind, tends to get in the way of normal emotional development, and thus of that particular success in life which we call happiness."
"A full bosom is actually a millstone around a woman's neck. ... [Breasts] are not parts of a person but lures slung around her neck, to be kneaded and twisted like magic putty, or mumbled and mouthed like lolly ices."
Plain women know more about men than beautiful ones do.
"People are crying up the rich and variegated plumage of the peacock, and he is himself blushing at the sight of his ugly feet."
"I'm walking insecurity. Without all this makeup, I look like a refugee when I get up in the morning.... I generally look like one major bowwow. I mean arf."
"You start out happy that you have no hips or boobs. All of a sudden you get them, and it feels sloppy. Then just when you start liking them, they start dropping."
The problem with beauty is that it's like being born rich and getting poorer.
"Guys think that if a girl is pretty, she's automatically going to say no. Most of the guy's I've gone out with, I've had to make it completely obvious that I'd like them to ask me out. Or, I've had to ask them."
"I think if I weren't so beautiful, maybe I'd have more character."
Not many people ask me out.
"The striking point about our model family is not simply the compete-compete, consume-consume style of life it urges us to follow. The striking point, in the face of all the propaganda, is how few Americans actually live this way."
"Instead of comparing our lot with that of those who are more fortunate than we are, we should compare it with the lot of the great majority of our fellow men. It then appears that we are among the privileged."
"I murmured because I had no shoes, until I met man who had no feet."
"Comparison, more than reality, makes men happy or wretched."
The man with a toothache thinks everyone happy whose teeth are sound. The poverty-stricken man makes the same mistake about the rich man.
"If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself."
I look at what I have not and think myself unhappy; others look at what I have and think me happy.
Enjoy your own life without comparing it with that of another.
"If we only wanted to be happy it would be easy; but we want to be happier than other people, which is almost always difficult, since we think them happier than they are."
I never admired another's fortune so much that I became dissatisfied with my own.
Every horse thinks his own pack heaviest.
Comparisons of one's lot with others' teaches us nothing and enfeebles the will.
"To think well of every other man's condition, and to dislike our own, is one of the misfortunes of human nature."
Other people's eggs have two yolks.
No story ever looks as bad as the story you've just bought; no story ever looks as good as the story the other fellow just bought.
"If all our misfortunes were laid in one common heap, whence every one must take an equal portion, most people would be content to take their own and depart."
"Money, it turned out, was exactly like sex; you thought of nothing else if you didn't have it and thought of other things if you did."
Envy is an insult to oneself.
Jealousy is no more than feeling alone against smiling enemies.
Envy has the ugliness of a trapped rat that has gnawed its own foot in its effort to escape.
Jealousy is never satisfied with anything short of omniscience that would detect the subtlest fold in the heart.
Envy eats nothing but its own heart.
Jealousy is all the fun you think they had.
Jealousy would be far less torturous if we understood that love is a passion entirely unrelated to our merits.
In jealousy there is more of self-love than love.
Jealousy is an inner consciousness of one's own inferiority. It is a mental cancer.
"Jealousy, that dragon which slays love under the pretense of keeping it alive."
"There is no greater glory than love, nor any greater punishment than jealousy."
"As a moth gnaws a garment, so doth envy consume a man."
"Envy is the most stupid of vices, for there is no single advantage to be gained from it."
"The jealous are troublesome to others, but torment to themselves."
Envy and fear are the only passions to which no pleasure is attached.
"If malice or envy were tangible and had a shape, it would be the shape of a boomerang."
Envy is a kind of praise.
"Envy, among other ingredients, has a mixture of the love of justice in it. We are more angry at undeserved than at deserved good fortune."
"Envy comes from people's ignorance of, or lack of belief in, their own gifts."
"To cure jealousy is to see it for what it is, a dissatisfaction with self."
"If envy were a fever, all the world would be ill."
Jealousy is not a barometer by which the depth of love can be read. It merely records the degree of the lover's insecurity.
The heaven of the envied is hell for the envious.
You can't be envious and happy at the same time.
The whole art of life is knowing the right time to say things.
It is not until you become a mother that your judgment slowly turns to compassion and understanding.
"If we would build on a sure foundation in friendship, we must love friends for their sake rather than for our own."
"Friendship, which is of its nature a delicate thing, fastidious, slow of growth, is easily checked, will hesitate, demur, recoil where love, good old blustering love, bowls ahead and blunders through every obstacle."
It is all right to say exactly what you think if you have learned to think exactly.
Silence sweeter is than speech.
"When we get to wishing a great deal for ourselves, whatever we get soon turns into mere limitation and exclusion."
The opposite of talking isn't listening. The opposite of talking is waiting.
"Listening is not merely not talking, though even that is beyond most of our powers; it means taking a vigorous, human interest in what is being told us."
Why is it that people who cannot show feeling presume that that is a strength and not a weakness?
True love grows by sacrifice and the more thoroughly the soul rejects natural satisfaction the stronger and more detached its tenderness becomes.
The nice thing about teamwork is that you always have others on your side.
"If you wish to fear nothing, consider that everything is to be feared."
I am deliberate and afraid of nothing.
I survived my childhood by birthing many separate identities to stand in for one another in times of great stress and fear.
"How does one kill fear? ... How do you shoot a specter through the heart, slash off its spectral head, take it by its spectral throat?"
"The brave man is not he who feels no fear, For that were stupid and irrational; But he, whose noble soul its fear subdues, And barely dares the danger nature shrinks from."
Perhaps the most important thing we can undertake toward the reduction of fear is to make it easier for people to accept themselves; to like themselves.
"When fear seizes, change what you are doing. You are doing something wrong."
Grab the broom of anger and drive off the beast of fear.
We will not be driven by fear ... if we remember that we are not descended from fearful men.
"When we are afraid we ought not to occupy ourselves with endeavoring to prove that there is no danger, but in strengthening ourselves to go on in spite of the danger."
"Every time I start a picture ... I feel the same fear, the same self-doubts . . . and I have only one source on which I can draw, because it comes from within me."
Fear is met and destroyed with courage.
"A cheerful frame of mind, reinforced by relaxation, which in itself banishes fatigue, is the medicine that puts all ghosts of fear on the run."
To hell with pleasure that's haunted by fear!
"What I emphasize is for people to make choices based not on fear, but on what really gives them a sense of fulfillment."
"I steer my bark with hope in my heart, leaving fear astern."
"Why should a man fear, since chance is all in all for him, and he can clearly fore-know nothing? Best to live lightly as one can, unthinking."
"I sought the Lord, and He heard me, and delivered me from all my fears."
Any device whatever by which one frees himself from fear is a natural good.
Joking about death-or anything else that oppresses us-makes it less frightening.
Humor acts to relieve fear.
"If you can keep your head when all about are losing theirs, it's just possible you haven't grasped the situation."
"Fear is a kind of bell, or gong, which rings the mind into quick life and avoidance upon the approach of danger. It is the soul's signal for rallying."
"If you can keep your head when all about are losing theirs, it's just possible you haven't grasped the situation."
Fear is an emotion indispensable for survival.
"Fear is the single strongest motivating force in our lives. ... The more frightened you become, the better your chances of achieving success."
We only really face up to ourselves when we are afraid.
"If you're never scared or embarrassed or hurt, it means you never take any chances."
Fear makes us feel our humanity.
A coward's fear can make a coward valiant.
Fear drives you and makes you better.
"Fear is an instructor of great sagacity, and the herald of all revolutions."
"Just as courage imperils life, fear protects it."
"In order to feel anything, you need strength."
There are times when fear is good. It must keep its watchful place at the heart's controls.
A danger foreseen is half avoided.
A good scare is worth more to a man than good advice.
Fear is a fine spur.
"Fear is a question: What are you afraid of, and why? Just as the seed of health is an illness, because illness contains information, our fears are a treasure house of self-knowledge if we explore them."
Men who fear God face life fearlessly. Men who do not fear God end up fearing everything.
It is only the fear of God that can deliver us from the fear of men.
"Being scared can keep a man from getting killed, and often makes a better fighter of him."
"Nerves provide me with energy.... It's when I don't have them, when I feel at ease, that I get worried."
Fear is an emotion indispensable for survival.
Fear gives sudden instincts of skill.
I quit being afraid when my first venture failed and the sky didn't fall down.
Fear of losing is what makes competitors so great. Show me a gracious loser and I'll show you a permanent loser.
Fear is the father of courage and the mother of safety.
"Fear is the needle that pierces us, that it may carry a thread to bind us to heaven."
Fear is the thought of admitted inferiority.
Fear is nature's warning signal to get busy.
"Fear is an uneasiness of the mind, upon the thought of a future evil likely to befall us."
"Fear is a cloak which old men huddle about their love, as if to keep it warm."
Fear is the tax that conscience pays to guilt.
Fear is pain arising from the anticipation of evil.
Fear is the soul's signal for rallying.

Perfection does not exist. To understand this is the triumph of human intelligence; to expect to possess it is the most dangerous kind of madness.
So much perfection argues rottenness somewhere.
The essence of man is imperfection.
A new idea is rarely born like Venus attended by graces. More commonly it's modeled of baling wire and acne. More commonly it wheezes and tips over.
The essence of being human is that one does not seek perfection.
There is no perfection in humanity.

"A real friend helps us think our best thoughts, do our noblest deeds, be our finest selves."
Friendship is a furrow in the sand.
Friendship is love without his wings!
True friendship is self-love at second hand.
The real friend is he or she who can share all our sorrow and double our joys.
Friendship is a word the very sight of which in print makes the heart warm.
Most men's friendships are too inarticulate.
My philosophy is: anyone or anything that gives you knowledge inspires you.
The feeling of friendship is like that of being comfortably filled with roast beef.
The easiest kind of relationship for me is with ten thousand people. The hardest is with one.
It is easier to forgive an enemy than it is a friend.
To act the part of a true friend requires more conscientious feeling than to fill with credit and complacency any other station or capacity in social life.
"Friendship is an art, and very few persons are born with a natural gift for it."
Female friendships that work are relationships in which women help each other belong to themselves.
"The language of friendship is not words, but meanings."
"I can trust my friends. ... These people force me to examine myself, encourage me to grow."
We challenge one another to be funnier and smarter. ... It's the way friends make love to one another.
"If I made it, it's half because I was game enough to take a lot of punishment along the way and half because there were a lot of people who cared enough to help me."
Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharp-eneth the countenance of his friend.
A friend can tell you things you don't want to tell yourself.
"I suppose there is one friend in the life of each of us who seems not a separate person, however dear and beloved, but an expansion, an interpretation, of one's self."
Love demands infinitely less than friendship.
Good company upon the road is the shortest cut.
The particular human chain we're a part of is central to our individual identity.
"No person is your friend who demands your silence, or denies your right to grow."
The best preservative to keep the mind in health is the faithful admonition of a friend.
"What is thine is mine, and all mine is thine."
"Do not protect yourself by a fence, but rather by your friends."
"If our friends' idealizations of us need the corrective of our own experience, it may be true also that our own sordid view of our lives needs the corrective of our friends' idealizations."
"In meeting again after a separation, acquaintances ask after our outward life, friends after our inner life."
"In real friendship the judgment, the genius, the prudence of each party become the common property of both."
"The thicker one gets with some people, the thinner they become."
"When our friends are alive, we see the good qualities they lack; dead, we remember only those they possessed."
The company makes the feast.
"When one friend washes another, both become clean."
"I observed once to Goethe ... that when a friend is with us we do not think the same of him as when he is away. He replied, ""Yes! because the absent friend is yourself, and he exists only in your head; whereas the friend who is present has an individuality of his own, and moves according to laws of his own, which cannot always be in accordance with those which you form for yourself."""
"In reality, we are still children. We want to find a playmate for our thoughts and feelings."
"Love me, please; I love you; I can bear to be your friend. So ask of me anything ... I am not a tentative person. Whatever I do, I give up my whole self to it."
Most of our misfortunes are comments of our friends upon them.
"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends."
"Animals are such agreeable friends- they ask no questions, they pass no criticisms."
Great friendship is never without anxiety.
"One out of four people in this country is mentally imbalanced. Think of your three closest friends and if they seem okay, then you're the one."
"She is one of my best friends. Why, I've known her ever since we were the same age."
You never know how many friends you have until you rent a cottage at the beach.
"There are two kinds of people in the world: those who come into a room and say, ""Here I am!"" and those who come in and say, ""Oh, there you are."""
Friends are folks who excuse you when you have made a fool of yourself.
"A word of advice, don't give it."
Advice is what we ask for when we already know the answer but wish we didn't.
Here's a toast to someone who's truly a best friend - a person who goes around telling good things behind your back.
My friend thought he was not gonna make it. Then he started thinking positive. Now he's positive he's not gonna make it.
We cherish our friends not for their ability to amuse us but for ours to amuse them.
There ain't no surer way to find out whether you like people or hate them than to travel with them.
It takes a long time to grow an old friend.
With friends like you - who needs enemas.
Here's a dime. Call all your friends.
"We are both great men, but I have succeeded better in keeping it a profound secret than he has."
"As the psychiatrist said to the cannibal at the end of a session: ""Your problem is easy you're just fed up with people."""
"Should auld acquaintances be forgot, And never brought to mind? Should auld acquaintance be forgot, And days o'auld lang syne?"
"Friendship, peculiar boon of Heaven, The noble mind's delight and pride, To men and angels only given, To all the lower world denied."
"What is thine is mine, and all mine is thine."
"Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided."
"Madam, I have been looking for a person who disliked gravy all my life; let us swear eternal friendship."
"Be slow to fall into friendship, but when thou art in continue firm and constant."
True friendship is a plant of slow growth and must undergo and withstand the shocks of adversity before it is entitled to the appellation.
By their fruits ye shall know them.
The ripest fruit first falls.
The best way to remember your wife's birthday is to forget it once.
She's too young for Medicare and too old for me to care.
Gray hair is God's graffiti.
"I lived in Miami for a while, in a section with a lot of really old people. The average age in my apartment house was dead."
"Good Americans, when they die, go to Paris."
We had a very successful trip to Russia we got back.
Enjoy life. Think of all the women who passed up dessert on the Titanic.
Everybody should believe in something; I believe I'll have another drink.
I know lots more old drunks than old doctors.
"I'm a one-drink woman, two at the most, three I'm under the table, four I'm under the host."
My doctor said I look like a million dollars - green and wrinkled.
Condoms aren't completely safe. A friend of mine was wearing one . . . and got hit by a bus.
"My doctor gave me six months to live, but when I couldn't pay the bill, he gave me six months more."
"I can't believe that out of a hundred thousand sperm, you were the quickest."
I hope you live to be as old as your jokes.
"My wife is the most wonderful woman in the world, and that's not just my opinion - it's hers."
"she: Before we got married, you told me you were well-off. he: I was, and I didn't know it."
A good marriage would be between a blind wife and a deaf husband.
Why did God make man before he made woman? Because he didn't want any advice on how to do it.

"When all else is lost, the future still remains."
"Tis the sunset of life gives me mystical lore, And coming events cast their shadows before."
I never think of the future. It comes soon enough.
I know of no way of judging the future but by the past.
The present is great with the future
"Trust no Future, howe'er pleasant! Let the dead Past bury its dead!"
Go forth to meet the shadowy Future without fear and with a manly heart.
Take therefore no thought for the morrow; for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
There was the Door to which I found no key; There was the Veil through which I might not see.
There was a wise man in the East whose constant prayer was that he might see today with the eyes of tomorrow.
"I believe the future is only the past again, entered through another gate."
"Till the sun grows cold, And the stars are old, And the leaves of the Judgment Book unfold."

"A garden is a lovesome thing - God wot! Rose plot, Fringed pool, Fern grot -  The veriest school Of peace; and yet the fool Contends that God is not. -  Not God in gardens! When the sun is cool? Nay, but I have a sign! 'Tis very sure God walks in mine."

"Even if you're on the right track, you'll get run over if you just sit there."
The first step is the hardest.

Every beginning is hard.
A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.
"Whenever you take a step forward, you are bound to disturb something."

Everyone who got where he is had to begin where he was.
"Change your life today. Don't gamble on the future, act now, without delay."

"Don't wait for your ""ship to come in,"" and feel angry and cheated when it doesn't. Get going with something small."
Don't sit down and wait for the opportunities to come; you have to get up and make them.
The individual activity of one man with backbone will do more than a thousand men with a mere wishbone.
With mere good intentions hell is proverbially paved.
All the beautiful sentiments in the world weigh less than a single lovely action.
It is vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquility: they must have action; and they will have it if they cannot find it.

"Men expect too much, do too little."
"Action may not always bring happiness, but there is no happiness without action."
Things don't turn up in this world until somebody turns them up.
Act-act in the living present!
Life is essentially a series of events to be lived through rather than intellectual riddles to be played with and solved.
There are risks and costs to a program of action. But they are far less than the long-range risks and costs of comfortable inaction.
What you don't do can be a destructive force.
He that is overcautious will accomplish little.
"Untilled ground, however rich, will bring forth thistles and thorns; so also the mind of man."
Often greater risk is involved in postponement than in making a wrong decision.
The bitterest tears shed over graves are for words left unsaid and deeds left undone.

"Words are mere bubbles of water, but deeds are drops of gold."
"Ef women want any rights more'n dey got, why don't dey jes' take 'em and not be talkin' about it."
All talk of women's rights is moonshine. Women have every right. They have only to exercise them.
A man of words and not of deeds is like a garden full of weeds.
"Life is worth being lived, but not worth being discussed all the time."
"Action, not words, are the true criterion of the attachment of friends."
Words without actions are the assassins of idealism.
"If you have something to do that is worthwhile doing, don't talk about it ... do it."
"If deeds are wanting, all words appear mere vanity and emptiness."

I like to deliver more than I promise instead of the other way around.
"When I talked, no one listened to me. But as soon as I acted I became persuasive, and I no longer find anyone incredulous."
"If you can talk brilliantly about a problem, it can create the consoling illusion that it has been mastered."
Words gain credibility by deed.
Men are alike in their promises. It is only in their deeds that they differ.
An acre of performance is worth a whole world of promise.
Well done is better than well said.
Our chief defect is that we are more given to talking about things than to doing them.
We have too many sounding words and too few actions that correspond with them.
Activity in back of a very small idea will produce more than inactivity and the planning of a genius.
"When it comes to getting things done, we need fewer architects and more bricklayers."
"Get good counsel before you begin; and when you have decided, act promptly."
"Ideas are one thing, and what happens is another."
Thinking about swimming isn't much like actually getting in the water. Actually getting in the water can take your breath away.
"All worthwhile men have good thoughts, good ideas and good intentions, but precious few of them ever translate those into action."
"A thought which does not result in an action is nothing much, and an action which does not proceed from a thought is nothing at all."
To think is easy. To act is difficult. To act as one thinks is the most difficult of all.

"Contemplation often makes life miserable. We should act more, think less, and stop watching ourselves live."
"What you theoretically know, vividly realize."

Action will remove the doubt that theory cannot solve.
It is a common observation that those who dwell continually upon their expectations are apt to become oblivious to the requirements of their actual situation.
He who deliberates fully before taking a step will spend his entire life on one leg.
We don't have enough time to premeditate all our actions.
The opportunity is often lost by deliberating.
To think too long about doing a thing often becomes its undoing.
"Do not wait for ideal circumstances, nor the best opportunities; they will never come."
"Do what you can, with what you have, where you are."
Anything worth doing is worth doing too soon.
"""Now"" is the operative word. Everything you put in your way is just a method of putting off the hour when you could actually be doing your dream."
"Common sense does not ask an impossible chessboard, but takes the one before it and plays the game."
I don't wait for moods. You accomplish nothing if you do that. Your mind must know it has got to get down to earth.
My evil genius Procrastination has whispered me to tarry 'til a more convenient season.
"I realize that if I wait until I am no longer afraid to act, write, speak, be, I'll be sending messages on a ouija board, cryptic complaints from the other side."
He who postpones the hour of living is like the rustic who waits for the river to run out before he crosses.
"Being unready and ill-equipped is what you have to expect in life. It is the universal predicament. It is your lot as a human being to lack what it takes. Circumstances are seldom right. You never have the capacities, the strength, the wisdom, the virtue you ought to have. You must always do with less than you need in a situation vastly different from what you would have chosen."
He who hesitates is last.
Conditions are never just right. People who delay action until all factors are favorable do nothing.
"You decide you'll wait for your pitch. Then as the ball starts toward the plate, you think about your stance. And then you think about your swing. And then you realize that the ball that went past you for a strike was your pitch."
"So what do we do? Anything. Something. So long as we just don't sit there. If we screw it up, start over. Try something else. If we wait until we've satisfied all the uncertainties, it may be too late."
Nothing at all will be attempted if all possible objections must first be overcome.
"No age or time of life, no position or circumstance, has a monopoly on success. Any age is the right age to start doing!"
Everyone must row with the oars he has.
"The question for each man is not what he would do if he had the means, time, influence and educational advantages, but what he will do with the things he has."
"How many opportunities come along? If you wait for the right one, that's wrong, because it may never be right, and what have you got to lose? Even if it's a disaster, you've tried, you've learned something, you've had an adventure. And that doesn't mean you can't do it again."
"And now, Lord, what wait I for?"
We should be taught not to wait for inspiration to start a thing. Action always generates inspiration. Inspiration seldom generates action.
If you wait for inspiration you'll be standing on the corner after the parade is a mile down the street.
The best place to succeed is where you are with what you have.
One of these days is none of these days.
Who waits until the wind shall silent keep Will never find the ready hour to sow.
Begin somewhere; you cannot build a reputation on what you intend to do.
"If you wait for the perfect moment when all is safe and assured, it may never arrive. Mountains will not be climbed, races won, or lasting happiness achieved."
There is nothing to be gained by waiting for a better situation. You see where you are and you do what you can with that.
"It is in your act that you exist, not in your body. Your act is yourself, and there is no other you."
The things people discard tell more about them than the things they keep.
The test of any man lies in action.
"Every action we take, everything we do, is either a victory or defeat in the struggle to become what we want to be."
"It's where we go, and what we do when we get there, that tells us who we are."
By his deeds we know a man.
A human being has no discernible character until he acts.
"What we make is more important than what we are, particularly if making is our profession."
To do is to be.
You can't build a reputation on what you intend to do.
To be is to do.
The way to do is to be.
"The ordinary man is involved in action, the hero acts. An immense difference."
"We judge ourselves by what we feel capable of doing, while others judge us by what we have already done."

"When I am idle and shiftless, my affairs become confused; when I work, I get results ... not great results, but enough to encourage me."
"To be busy with material affairs is the best preservative against reflection, fears, doubts ... all these things which stand in the way of achievement. I suppose a fellow proposing to cut his throat would experience a sort of relief while occupied in stropping his razor carefully."
"Acting can work a peculiar magic on the actor ... it can cure you (at least for the length of a performance) of a whole variety of ailments. Migraine headaches, miserable colds or toothaches will suddenly disappear as you're up there going through your paces."
"It is only when I dally with what I am about, look back and aside instead of keeping my eyes straight forward, that I feel these cold sinkings of the heart. But the first broadside puts all to rights."
Action is the antidote to despair.

You can't get rich sitting on the bench.
Action makes more fortunes than caution.
"For purposes of action, nothing is more useful than narrowness of thought combined with energy of will."

Commitment leads to action. Action brings your dream closer.
One starts an action simply because one must do something.
"We couldn't possibly know where it would lead, but we knew it had to be done."

"Give an inch, he'll take an ell."
He gives twice who gives quickly.

Mine eyes have seen the coming of the glory of the Lord.
O how quickly passes away the glory of the earth.
One crowded hour of glorious life Is worth an age without a name.
God helps those who help themselves.
"Man proposes, and God disposes."
God's in His Heaven -  All's right with the world!
Fear that man who fears not God.
"Nearer, my God, to Thee - Nearer to Thee -  E'en though it be a cross That raiseth me; Still all my song shall be Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee!"
"I took a day to search for God, And found Him not. But as I trod By rocky ledge, through woods untamed, Just where one scarlet lily flamed, I saw His foot print in the sod."

An honest God is the noblest work of man.

The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth his handiwork.

The divine essence itself is love and wisdom.
"God, the Great Giver, can open the whole universe to our gaze in the narrow space of a single lane."
"Rock of Ages, cleft for me, Let me hide myself in thee."
God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb.
"If there were no God, it would be necessary to invent him."
"Give way to the Better if way to the Better there be, It exacts a full look at the Worst."
The significance of a man is not in what he attains but rather in what he longs to attain.
"Once you say you're going to settle for second, that's what happens to you in life, I find."
A successful individual typically sets his next goal somewhat but not too much above his last achievement. In this way he steadily raises his level of aspiration.
The most absurd and reckless aspirations have sometimes led to extraordinary success.
All rising to great places is by a winding stair.
The only thing to know is how to use your neuroses.
"Every ceiling, when reached, becomes a floor, upon which one walks as a matter of course and prescriptive right."
We can always redeem the man who aspires and strives.
The world stands aside to let anyone pass who knows where he is going.
"I have learned to have very modest goals for society and myself, things like clean air, green grass, children with bright eyes, not being pushed around, useful work that suits one's abilities, plain tasty food, and occasional satisfying nookie."
"If you would hit the mark, you must aim a little above it: Every arrow that flies feels the attraction of earth."
"Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a heaven for?"
"Before we set our hearts too much upon anything, let us examine how happy they are, who already possess it."
Ours is a world where people don't know what they want and are willing to go through hell to get it.
"Accept the place the divine providence has found for you, the society of your contemporaries, the connection of events."
Those who aim at great deeds must also suffer greatly.

"Do not wish to be anything but what you are, and try to be that perfectly."
"This one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark!"
"Winning isn't everything, but wanting to win is."
It is no longer clear which way is up even if one wants to rise.
Ambition is pitiless. Any merit that it cannot use it finds despicable.
Every man is said to have his peculiar ambition.
Well is it known that ambition can creep as well as soar.
"Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir men's blood . . . Make big plans, aim high in hope and work."
An aim in life is the only fortune worth finding.
You have to have a dream so you can get up in the morning.
"What an immense power over the life is the power of possessing distinct aims. The voice, the dress, the look, the very motions of a person, define and alter when he or she begins to live for a reason."
"If I had one wish for my children, it would be that each of them would reach for goals that have meaning for them as individuals."
The tragedy of life doesn't lie in not reaching your goal. The tragedy lies in having no goal to reach.
Purpose is what gives life a meaning.
Nothing contributes so much to tranquilize the mind as a steady purpose-a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye.
"The poor man is not he who is without a cent, but he who is without a dream."
"He is conscious of touching the highest pinnacle of fulfillment... when he is consumed in the service of an idea, in the conquest of the goal pursued."
He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.
The great and glorious masterpiece of man is to know how to live to purpose.
"Great minds have purposes, others have wishes."
"Unless you give yourself to some great cause, you haven't even begun to live."
"If we could only give, just once, the same amount of reflection to what we want to get out of life that we give to the question of what to do with a two weeks' vacation, we would be startled at our false standards and the aimless procession of our busy days."
"Be a life long or short, its completeness depends on what it was lived for."
"To live means to have ... a mission to fulfill-and in the measure in which we avoid setting our life to something, we make it empty."
"To seek one's goals and to drive toward it, steeling one's heart, is most uplifting!"
The true worth of a man is to be measured by the objects he pursues.
A useless life is an early death.
"My father used to play with my brother and me in the yard. Mother would come out and say, ""You're tearing up the grass."" ""We're not raising grass,"" Dad would reply. ""We're raising boys."""
"Without a purpose, nothing should be done."
To grow and know what one is growing towards-that is the source of all strength and confidence in life.
"Our plans miscarry because they have no aim. When a man does not know what harbor he is making for, no wind is the right wind."

"No pleasure philosophy, no sensuality, no place nor power, no material success can for a moment give such inner satisfaction as the sense of living for good purpose."
"Many are stubborn in pursuit of the path they have chosen, few in pursuit of the goal."
There is one thing which gives radiance to everything. It is the idea of something around the corner.
Lack of something to feel important about is almost the greatest tragedy a man may have.
"There are three ingredients in the good life: learning, earning and yearning."
"If you cry ""Forward,"" you must make plain in what direction to go."
"Men, like nails, lose their usefulness when they lose direction and begin to bend."
"A novelist must know what his last chapter is going to say and one way or another work toward that last chapter. ... To me it is utterly basic, yet it seems like it's a great secret."
Obstacles are those frightful things you see when you take your eyes off the goal.
You must have long-range goals to keep you from being frustrated by short-range failures.
The world stands aside to let anyone pass who knows where he is going.
"This is true joy of life-the being used for a purpose that is recognized by yourself as a right one, instead of being a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances, complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy."
"Not only must we be good, but we must also be good for something."
"It is when things go hardest, when life becomes most trying, that there is greatest need for having a fixed goal. When few comforts come from without, it is all the more necessary to have a fount to draw on from within."
In everything one must consider the end.
A straight path never leads anywhere except to the objective.
There's some end at last for the man who follows a path; mere rambling is interminable.
Having a goal is a state of happiness.
"The American people can have anything they want; the trouble is, they don't know what they want."
Life has a meaning only if one barters it day by day for something other than itself.
"To have a reason to get up in the morning, it is necessary to possess a guiding principle. A belief of some kind. A bumper sticker, if you will."
"An aspiration is a joy forever, a possession as solid as a landed estate, a fortune which we can never exhaust and which gives us year by year a revenue of pleasurable activity."
The soul that has no established aim loses itself.
Life has a value only when it has something valuable as its object.
He turns not back who is bound to a star.
"He might never really do what he said, but at least he had it in mind. He had somewhere to go."
The great and glorious masterpiece of man is how to live with a purpose.
"What most counts is not to live, but to live aright."
Choosing a goal and sticking to it changes everything.
No wind serves him who addresses his voyage to no certain port.
"Laboring toward distant aims sets the mind in a higher key, and puts us at our best."
Everything's in the mind. That's where it all starts. Knowing what you want is the first step toward getting it.
Set short term goals and you'll win games. Set long term goals and you'll win championships!
"We act as though comfort and luxury were the chief requirements of life, when all that we need to make us really happy is something to be enthusiastic about."
Unhappiness is in not knowing what we want and killing ourselves to get it.
Having a dream isn't stupid. ... It's not having a dream that's stupid.
Happiness is the overcoming of not unknown obstacles toward a known goal.
To have no set purpose in one's life is the harlotry of the will.
There is no happiness except in the realization that we have accomplished something.
Strong lives are motivated by dynamic purposes.
One of the sources of pride in being a human being is the ability to bear present frustrations in the interests of longer purposes.
Only he who can see the invisible can do the impossible.
"If you don't know where you are going, how can you expect to get there?"
The only people who attain power are those who crave for it.
"Destiny is not a matter of chance, it is a matter of choice; it is not a thing to be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved."
"In this life we get only those things for which we hunt, for which we strive, and for which we are willing to sacrifice."
You seldom get what you go after unless you know in advance what you want.
"Where no plan is laid, where the disposal of time is surrendered merely to the chance of incident, chaos will soon reign."
A life that hasn't a definite plan is likely to become driftwood.
Only he who keeps his eye fixed on the far horizon will find his right road.
"Fortunate is the person who has developed the self-control to steer a straight course toward his objective in life, without being swayed from his purpose by either commendation or condemnation."
Nothing is more terrible than activity without insight.
"If we would only give, just once, the same amount of reflection to what we want to get out of life that we give to the question of what to do with a two weeks' vacation, we would be startled at our false standards and the aimless procession of our busy days."
The purpose of life is a life of purpose.
Aim at nothing and you'll succeed.
The purpose of life is life.
Goals are dreams with deadlines.
"So long as I believe I have to do certain things, I will just go right ahead. That's how I run my life."
A schedule defends from chaos and whim. It is a net for catching days. It is a scaffolding on which a worker can stand and labor with both hands at sections of time.
"You decide what it is you want to accomplish and then you lay out your plans to get there, and then you just do it. It's pretty straightforward."
What does so-called success or failure matter if only you have succeeded in doing the thing you set out to do. The doing is all that really counts.
"Get out of the blocks, run your race, stay relaxed. If you run your race, you'll win. Channel your energy. Focus."
Know what you want to do-then do it. Make straight for your goal and go undefeated in spirit to the end.
"There is a place in God's sun for the youth ""farthest down"" who has the vision, the determination, and the courage to reach it."
Every man is said to have his peculiar ambition.
"We all live with the objective of being happy; our lives are all different, and yet the same."
Follow your bliss. Find where it is and don't be afraid to follow it.
You can't assume the responsibility for everything you do-or don't do.
"There were angry men confronting me and I caught the flashing of defiant eyes, but above me and within me, there was a spirit stronger than them all."
"A woman finds the natural lay of the land almost unconsciously; and not feeling it incumbent on her to be guide and philosopher to any successor, she takes little pains to mark the route by which she is making her ascent."
"No matter what the competition is, I try to find a goal that day and better that goal."
It doesn't matter what anybody thinks of what I do. The clock doesn't lie.
You can have your titular recognition. I'll take money and power.
"Normal is not something to aspire to, it's something to get away from."
I'm always making a comeback but nobody ever tells me where I've been.
My passions were all gathered together like fingers that made a fist. Drive is considered aggression today; I knew it then as purpose.
"In the multitude of middle-aged men who go about their vocations in a daily course determined for them much in the same way as they tie their cravats, there is always a good number who once meant to shape their own deeds and alter the world a little."
"Remember if people talk behind your back, it only means you're two steps ahead!"
It's a sign of your own worth sometimes if you are hated by the right people.
For me it's the challenge-the challenge to try to beat myself or do better than I did in the past. I try to keep in mind not what I have accomplished but what I have to try to accomplish in the future.
There's a very fine line between a groove and a rut; a fine line between eccentrics and people who are just plain nuts.
Promises that you make to yourself are often like the Japanese plum tree-they bear no fruit.
"I am not sending messages with my feet. All I ever wanted was not to come up empty. I did it for the dough, and the old applause."
"First say to yourself what you would be, and then do what you have to do."
"I can honestly say that I was never affected by the question of the success of an undertaking. If I felt it was the right thing to do, I was for it regardless of the possible outcome."
"What exactly is success? For me it is to be found not in applause, but in the satisfaction of feeling that one is realizing one's ideal."
"We can do whatever we wish to do provided our wish is strong enough. ... What do you want most to do? That's what I have to keep asking myself, in the face of difficulties."
"To be what we are, and to become what we are capable of becoming, is the only end of life."
"You have to define success in your own way. What maintains your dignity and integrity and what is your life's plan, where do you want to put your efforts. I could be richer and more famous, but I would have to give up things that are of infinitely more value."
You cannot do good work if you take your mind off the work to see how the community is taking it.
"When the shriveled skin of the ordinary is stuffed out with meaning, it satisfies the senses amazingly."
"Our victory is sure to come, and I can endure anything but recreancy to principle."
"If you just set out to be liked, you would be prepared to compromise on anything at any time, and you would achieve nothing."
"Concentrate on finding your goal, then concentrate on reaching it."
Enthusiasm for one's goal lessens the disagreeableness of working toward it.
I'm not going to let my life revolve around losing weight. I have other things to do.
"The streams which would otherwise diverge to fertilize a thousand meadows, must be directed into one deep narrow channel before they can turn a mill."
He who wants to do everything will never do anything.
"As you emphasize your life, you must localize and define it... you cannot do everything."
"There are people who want to be everywhere at once, and they get nowhere."
Leader and followers are both following the invisible leader-the common purpose.
"A windmill is eternally at work to accomplish one end, although it shifts with every variation of the weathercock, and assumes ten different positions in a day."
People can have many different kinds of pleasure. The real one is that for which they will forsake the others.
"Nations, like individuals, have to limit their objectives or take the consequences."
"One of the most important factors, not only in military matters but in life as a whole, is ... the ability to direct one's whole energies towards the fulfillment of a particular task."
It is in self-limitation that a master first shows himself.
"One cannot manage too many affairs: like pumpkins in the water, one pops up while you try to hold down the other."
One principle reason why men are so often useless is that they ... divide and shift their attention among a multitude of objects and pursuits.
I can tell you how to get what you want: You've just got to keep a thing in view and go for it and never let your eyes wander to right or left or up or down. And looking back is fatal.
He who begins many things finishes but few.
Who begins too much accomplishes little.
Never try to catch two frogs with one hand.
"If you run after two hares, you will catch neither."
The greyhound that starts many hares kills none.
A bull does not enjoy fame in two herds.
"The man who seeks one thing in life, and but one May hope to achieve it before life be done. But he who seeks all things wherever he goes Only reaps from the hopes which around him he sows A harvest of barren regrets."
"Those who attain any excellence commonly spend life in one pursuit; for excellence is not often granted upon easier terms. -Samuel Johnson No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other."
"He who wishes to fulfill his mission in the world must be a man of one idea, one great overmastering purpose, overshadowing all his aims, and guiding and controlling his entire life."
"Firmness of purpose is one of the most necessary sinews of character and one of the best instruments of success. Without it, genius wastes its efforts in a maze of inconsistencies."
"A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways.... A determinate purpose in life, and a steady adhesion to it through all disadvantages, are indispensable conditions of success."
"If you would be Pope, you must think of nothing else."
"One should want only one thing and want it constantly. Then one is sure of getting it. But I desire everything, and consequently get nothing."
"I care not what your education is, elaborate or nothing, what your mental calibre is, great or small, that man who concentrates all his energies of body, mind and soul in one direction is a tremendous man."
He who hunts two hares leaves one and loses the other.
He who serves two masters has to lie to one.
All animals except man know that the ultimate of life is to enjoy it.
What does so-called success or failure matter if only you have succeeded in doing the thing you set out to do. The doing is all that really counts.
"Catching something is purely a byproduct of our fishing. It is the act of fishing that wipes away all grief, lightens all worry, dissolves all fear and anxiety."
"Let us live, while we are alive!"
"Life is an end in itself, and the only question as to whether it is worth living is whether you have had enough of it."
I take it as a prime cause of the present confusion of society that it is too sickly and too doubtful to use pleasure as a test of value.
There is no cure for birth and death save to enjoy the interval.
Life is about enjoying yourself and having a good time.
All men seek one goal: success or happiness.
"The goal of all civilization, all religious thought, and all that sort of thing is simply to have a good time. But man gets so solemn over the process that he forgets the end."
The business of life is to enjoy oneself; everything else is a mockery.
The true object of human life is play.
"Use your health, even to the point of wearing it out. That is what it is for. Spend all you have before you die; do not outlive yourself."
"Pleasure is the object, duty and the goal of all rational creatures."
Pleasure is the only thing to live for. Nothing ages like happiness.
I finally figured out the only reason to be alive is to enjoy it.
Life exists for the love of music or beautiful things.
There is only one meaning of life: the act of living itself.
The main obligation is to amuse yourself.
"From his cradle to the grave, a man never does a single thing which has any first and foremost object save one-to secure peace of mind, spiritual comfort, for himself."
"I take it that what all men are really after is some form of, perhaps only some formula of, peace."
There is no such thing as expecting too much.
Your goal should be out of reach but not out of sight.
"Why should I deem myself to be a chisel, when I could be the artist?"
"I've always had such high expectations for myself. I'm aware of them, but I can't relax them."
"I want to be great, or nothing. I won't be a commonplace dauber, so I don't intend to try any more."
"We're half the people, we should be half the Congress."
I think the key is for women not to set any limits.
It's expectation that differentiates you from the dead.
The state of the world today demands that women become less modest and dream/plan/act/risk on a larger scale.
"Aim at the sun, and you may not reach it; but your arrow will fly far higher than if aimed at an object on a level with yourself."
"When one paints an ideal, one does not need to limit one's imagination."
"If you would hit the mark, you must aim a little above it; every arrow that flies feels the attraction of earth."
People don't pay much attention to you when you are second best. I wanted to see what it felt like to be number one.
"Nearly every glamorous, wealthy, successful career woman you might envy now started out as some kind of schlepp."
The fact that I was a girl never damaged my ambitions to be a pope or an emperor.
"In the long run men hit only what they aim at. Therefore, though they should fall immediately, they had better aim at something high."
Each time I leaped I seemed to touch the sky and when I regained earth it seemed to be mine alone.
"The tragedy of life doesn't lie in not reaching your goal. The tragedy lies in having no goal to reach. It isn't a calamity to die with dreams unfulfilled, but it is a calamity not to dream. It is not disgrace to reach the stars, but it is a disgrace to have no stars to reach for. Not failure, but low aim, is a sin."
I have an almost complete disregard of precedent and a faith in the possibility of something better. It irritates me to be told how things always have been done. ... I defy the tyranny of precedent. I cannot afford the luxury of a closed mind. I go for anything new that might improve the past.
It's not enough to just swing at the ball. You've got to loosen your girdle and really let it fly.
"I am comforted by life's stability, by earth's unchangeableness. What has seemed new and frightening assumes its place in the unfolding of knowledge."
"Someday, someone will follow in my footsteps and preside over the White House as the President's spouse. And I wish him well."
The most absurd and reckless aspirations have sometimes led to extraordinary success.
"When you reach for the stars, you may not quite get one, but you won't come up with a handful of mud, either."
I might have been born in a hovel but I am determined to travel with the wind and the stars.
The brain is wider than the sky.
My motto: sans limites.
A lot of young girls have looked to their career paths and have said they'd like to be chief. There's been a change in the limits people see.
"[My father] said, Don't grow up to be a woman, and what he meant by that was, a housewife ... without any interests."
"Our being is subject to all the chances of life. There are so many things we are capable of, that we could be or do. The potentialities are so great that we never, any of us, are more than one-fourth fulfilled."
What else are we gonna live by if not dreams? We need to believe in something. What would really drive us crazy is to believe this reality we run into every day is all there is. If I don't believe that there's a happy ending out there-that will-you-marry-me in the sky-I can't keep working today.
People think that at the top there isn't much room. They tend to think of it as an Everest. My message is that there is tons of room at the top.
I am always more interested in what I am about to do than in what I have already done.
"We have believed-and we do believe now-that freedom is indivisible, that peace is indivisible, that economic prosperity is indivisible."
"I always ask the question, ""Is this what I want in my life?"""
Tell them that as soon as I can walk I'm going to fly!
He who demands little gets it.
"Unless in one thing or another we are straining toward perfection, we have forfeited our manhood."
It is necessary to try to surpass one's self always; this occupation ought to last as long as life.
I was born to be a remarkable woman; it matters little in what way or how. ... I shall be famous or I will die.
I never intended to become a run-of-the-mill person.
There is only one real sin and that is to persuade oneself that the second best is anything but second best.
"Too low they build, who build beneath the stars."
I have the same goal I've had ever since I was a little girl. I want to rule the world.
Your world is as big as you make it.
"Whatever course you have chosen for yourself, it will not be a chore but an adventure if you bring to it a sense of the glory of striving, if your sights are set far above the merely secure and mediocre."
"Once you say you're going to settle for second, that's what happens to you."
Aim at heaven and you get earth thrown in; aim at earth and you get neither.
"I truly believe that before I retire from public office, I'll be voting for a woman for president."
"We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars."
If I smashed the traditions it was because I knew no traditions.
"Aim at perfection in everything, though in most things it is unattainable. However they who aim at it, and persevere, will come much nearer to it than those whose laziness and despondency make them give it up as unattainable."
"One may miss the mark by aiming too high, as too low."
"Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss it, you will land among the stars."
We aim above the mark to hit the mark. Every act hath some falsehood or exaggeration in it.
Life is a petty thing unless it is moved by the indomitable urge to extend its boundaries.
"Far away in the sunshine are my highest inspirations. I many not reach them, but I can look up and see the beauty, believe in them and try to follow where they lead."
A man's worth is no greater than the worth of his ambitions.
"Not failure, but low aim, is crime."
"On the human chessboard, all moves are possible."
"Great is the road I climb, but... the garland offered by an easier effort is not worth the gathering."
I never took a position we were going to be a good ball club. I took the position we were going to be a winning ball club.
"Man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a heaven for?"
"Before you begin a thing, remind yourself that difficulties and delays quite impossible to foresee are ahead. ... You can only see one thing clearly and that is your goal. Form a mental vision of that and cling to it through thick and thin."
"You have to erect a fence and say, ""Okay, scale this."""
You can change your beliefs so they empower your dreams and desires. Create a strong belief in yourself and what you want.
Man can only receive what he sees himself receiving.
A person can grow only as much as his horizon allows.
"You must learn day by day, year by year, to broaden your horizon. The more things you love, the more you are interested in, the more you enjoy, the more you are indignant about, the more you have left when anything happens."
"Enjoyment is not a goal, it is a feeling that accompanies important ongoing activity."
"What our deepest self craves is not mere enjoyment, but some supreme purpose that will enlist all our powers and give unity and direction to our life."
"The very first condition of lasting happiness is that a life should be full of purpose, aiming at something outside self."
The only true happiness comes from squandering ourselves for a purpose.
There is more to life than just existing and having a pleasant time.
Happiness is not the end of life; character is.
"Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness. It is not attained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a worthy purpose."
A good goal is like a strenuous exercise-it makes you stretch.
It's weak and despicable to go on wanting things and not trying to get them.
Growth is not concerned with itself.
The self-confidence one builds from achieving difficult things and accomplishing goals is the most beautiful thing of all.
"If ambition doesn't hurt you, you haven't got it."
"We need to restore the full meaning of that old word, duty. It is the other side of rights."
"This is true joy of life-being used for a purpose that is recognized by yourself as a mighty one ... instead of being a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances, complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy."
That is happiness: to be dissolved into something completely great.
I looked on child rearing not only as a work of love and duty but as a profession that was fully as interesting and challenging as any honorable profession in the world and one that demanded the best I could bring to it.
Human happiness and moral duty are inseparably connected.
"The measure of a life, after all, is not its duration, but its donation."
"When we ... devote ourselves to the strict and unsparing performance of duty, ihen happiness comes of itself."
"Duties are what make life most worth living. Lacking them, you are not necessary to anyone."
"Seek happiness for its own sake, and you will not find it; seek for duty, and happiness will follow, as the shadow comes with the sunshine."
"True happiness ... is not attained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a worthy purpose."
The only true happiness comes from squandering ourselves for a purpose.
"True happiness, we are told, consists in getting out of one's self, but the point is not only to get out; you must stay out, and to stay out, you must have some absorbing errand."
Happiness is the natural flower of duty.
The happiest excitement in life is to be convinced that one is fighting for all one is worth on behalf of some clearly seen and deeply felt good.
The secret of living is to find ... the pivot of a concept on which you can make your stand.
The only ones among you who will be really happy are those who will have sought and found how to serve.
"He who never sacrificed a present to a future good, or a personal to a general one, can speak of happiness only as the blind speak of color."
There is no happiness except in the realization that we have accomplished something.
"The full-grown modern human being ... is conscious of touching the highest pinnacle of fulfillment... when he is consumed in the service of an idea, in the conquest of the goal pursued."
"Happiness is essentially a state of going somewhere, wholeheartedly, one-directionally, without regret or reservation."
A man's happiness: to do the things proper to man.
Happy the man who knows his duties!
I believe half the unhappiness in life comes from people being afraid to go straight at things.
Happiness is the overcoming of not unknown obstacles toward a known goal.
"Give a man health and a course to steer, and he'll never stop to trouble about whether he's happy or not."
Having a goal is a state of happiness.
Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort.
"Without duty, life is soft and boneless."
Never mind your happiness; do your duty.
"I probably hold the distinction of being one movie star who, by all laws of logic, should never have made it. At each stage of my career, I lacked the experience."
The man who succeeds above his fellows is the one who early in life discerns his object and toward that object habitually directs his powers. Even genius itself is but fine observation strengthened by fixity of purpose.
"If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours."
"A determinate purpose of life, and steady adhesion to it through all disadvantages, are indispensable conditions of success."
The secret of success is constancy to purpose.
"The man who fails because he aims astray, or because he does not aim at all, is to be found everywhere."
"Life has ... taught me not to expect success to be the inevitable result of my endeavors. She taught me to seek sustenance from the endeavor itself, but to leave the result to God."
"The object of war is not to die for your country, but to make the other bastard die for his."
The object of war is to survive it.
"If we want a free and peaceful world, if we want to make the deserts bloom and man grow to greater dignity as a human being-we can do it."
"The most comprehensive formulation of therapeutic goals is the striving for wholeheartedness: to be without pretense, to be emotionally sincere, to be able to put the whole of oneself into one's feelings, one's work, one's beliefs."
"I think the purpose of life is to be useful, to be responsible, to be honorable, to be compassionate. It is, after all, to matter: to count, to stand for something, to have made some difference that you lived at all."
"Only when men are connected to large, universal goals are they really happy-and one result of their happiness is a rush of creative activity."
"The great business of life is to be, to do, to do without, and to depart."
The proper function of man is to live-not to exist.
Life's objective is life itself.
I seek the utmost pleasure and the least pain.
"There are two things to aim at in life: first, to get what you want, and after that to enjoy it. Only the wisest of mankind achieve the second."
I am searching for that which every man seeks-peace and rest.
"Reach high, for stars lie hidden in your soul. Dream deep, for every dream precedes the goal."
Never undertake anything for which you wouldn't have the courage to ask the blessings of heaven.
The one thing worth living for is to keep one's soul pure.
The greatest use of life is to spend it for something that will outlast it.

"In the faces of men and women I see God and in my own face in the glass, I find letters from God dropt in the street, and every one is signed by God's name, and I leave them where they are, for I know that wheresoever I go others will punctually come for ever and ever."

One on God's side is a majority.

"God does not pay weekly, but he pays at the end."
The finding of God is the coming to one's own self.

Man proposes; God disposes.

"If God made us in his image, we have certainly returned the compliment."
"God does not die on the day when we cease to believe in a personal deity, but we die on the day when our lives cease to be illuminated by the steady radiance, renewed daily, of a wonder, the source of which is beyond all reason."
"We know only that we are living in these bodies and have a vague idea, because we have heard it, and because our faith tells us so, that we possess souls. As to what good qualities there may be in our souls, or who dwells within them, or how precious they are, those are things which we seldom consider and so we trouble little about carefully preserving the soul's beauty."
I believe in the incomprehensibility of God.
Every conjecture we can form with regard to the works of God has as little probability as the conjectures of a child with regard to the works of a man.
"God is incorporeal, divine, supreme, infinite. Mind, Spirit, Soul, Principle, Life, Truth, Love."
"No statement about God is simply, literally true. God is far more than can be measured, described, defined in ordinary language, or pinned down to any particular happening."
Who fathoms the Eternal Thought? Who talks of scheme and plan? The Lord is God! He needeth not The poor device of man.
"Some people want to see God with their eyes as they see a cow, and to love Him as they love their cow-for the milk and cheese and profit it brings them. This is how it is with people who love God for the sake of outward wealth or inward comfort."
Your mind cannot possibly understand God. Your heart already knows. Minds were designed for carrying out the orders of the heart.
A comprehended God is no God at all.
"""What do you think of God,"" the teacher asked. After a pause, the young pupil replied, ""He's not a think, he's a feel."""
"To them that ask, where have you seen the Gods, or how do you know for certain there are Gods, that you are so devout in their worship? I answer: Neither have I ever seen my own soul, and yet I respect and honor it."
"It is the heart which experiences God, not the reason."
"I always say my God will take care of me. If it's my time I'll go, and if it's not I won't. I feel that He really has a lot of important things for me to do. And He's going to make sure that I'm here to do them."
"God is like a mirror. The mirror never changes, but everybody who looks at it sees something different."
"God is to me that creative Force, behind and in the universe, who manifests Himself as energy, as life, as order, as beauty, as thought, as conscience, as love."
"God is incorporeal, divine, supreme, infinite. Mind, Spirit, Soul, Principle, Life, Truth, Love."

Jesus makes the bitterest mouthful taste sweet.
"The best remedy for those who are afraid, lonely, or unhappy is to go outside, somewhere where they can be quiet, alone with the heavens, nature, and God. Because only then does one feel that all is as it should be and that God wishes to see people happy, amidst the simple beauty of nature. As long as this exists, and it certainly always will, I know that then there will always be comfort for every sorrow, whatever the circumstances may be. And I firmly believe that nature brings solace in all troubles."
Whoever falls from God's right hand is caught into His left.
"If I saw the gates of hell open and I stood on the brink of the abyss, I would not despair, I would not lose hope of mercy, because I would trust in You, my God."

"One unquestioned text we read, All doubt beyond, all fear above; Nor crackling pile nor cursing creed Can burn or blot it: God is Love."
A true love of God must begin with a delight in his holiness.
"As to the aridity you are suffering from, it seems to me our Lord is treating you like someone He considers strong: He wants to test you and see if you love Him as much at times of aridity as when He sends you consolations. I think this is a very great favor for God to show you."
"The first condition of human goodness is something to love; the second, something to revere."

"False happiness is like false money; it passes for a long time as well as the true, and serves some ordinary occasions; but when it is brought to the touch, we find the lightness and alloy, and feel the loss."
There is more to life than just existing and having a pleasant time.
The test of enjoyment is the remembrance which it leaves behind.
"When I have been unhappy, I have heard an opera ... and it seemed the shrieking of winds; when I am happy, a sparrow's chirp is delicious to me. But it is not the chirp that makes me happy, but I that make it sweet."
Happiness depends upon ourselves.
"The U.S. Constitution doesn't guarantee happiness, only the pursuit of it. Your have to catch up with it yourself."
"Happiness belongs to those who are sufficient unto themselves. For all external sources of happiness and pleasure are, by their very nature, highly uncertain, precarious, ephemeral and subject to chance."
Most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.
"One is happy as a result of one's own efforts-once one knows the necessary ingredients of happiness-simple tastes, a certain degree of courage, self-denial to a point, love of work, and, above all, a clear conscience."
Nothing can bring you peace but yourself.
Discontent is want of self-reliance; it is infirmity of will.
I'm happier. ... I guess I made up my mind to be that way.
The essence of philosophy is that a man should so live that his happiness shall depend as little as possible on external things.
No one gives joy or sorrow. ... We gather the consequences of our own deeds.
"Happiness, happiness ... the flavor is with you-with you alone, and you can make it as intoxicating as you please."
Few are they who have never had the chance to achieve happiness ... and fewer those who have taken that chance.
To win one's joy through struggle is better than to yield to melancholy.
"Life is a romantic business, but you have to make the romance."
To be obliged to beg our daily happiness from others bespeaks a more lamentable poverty than that of him who begs his daily bread.
"Some pursue happiness, others create it."
Man is the artificer of his own happiness.
"The man who makes everything that leads to happiness depend upon himself, and not upon other men, has adopted the very best plan for living happily."
"It is not the level of prosperity that makes for happiness but the kinship of heart to heart and the way we look at the world. Both attitudes are within our power, so that a man is happy so long as he chooses to be happy, and no one can stop him."
Happy is he that chastens himself.
How unhappy is he who cannot forgive himself.
"There is always something left to love. And if you ain't learned that, you ain't learned nothing."
"Like swimming, riding, writing or playing golf, happiness can be learned."
"Being happy is something you have to learn. I often surprise myself by saying, ""Wow, this is it. I guess I'm happy. I've got a home that I love. A career that I love. I'm even feeling more and more at peace with myself."" If there's something else to happiness, let me know. I'm ambitious for that, too."
Learn how to feel joy.
"Someone once asked me what I regarded as the three most important requirements for happiness. My answer was: ""A feeling that you have been honest with yourself and those around you; a feeling that you have done the best you could both in your personal life and in your work; and the ability to love others."""
Nine requisites for contented living: Health enough to make work a pleasure. Wealth enough to support your needs. Strength to battle with difficulties and overcome them. Grace enough to confess your sins and forsake them. Patience enough to toil until some good is accomplished. Charity enough to see some good in your neighbor. Love enough to move you to be useful and helpful to others. Faith enough to make real the things of God. Hope enough to remove all anxious fears concerning the future.
"Happiness comes of the capacity to feel deeply, to enjoy simply, to think freely, to risk life, to be needed."
"Do not worry; eat three square meals a day; say your prayers; be courteous to your creditors; keep your digestion good; exercise; go slow and easy. Maybe there are other things your special case requires to make you happy; but, my friend, these I reckon will give you a good lift."
To love deeply in one direction makes us more loving in all others.
"Have a variety of interests. ... These interests relax the mind and lessen tension on the nervous system. People with many interests live, not only longest, but happiest."
"Build a little fence of trust Around today; Fill the space with loving work, And therein stay."
"This is wisdom: to love wine, beauty, and the heavenly spring. That's sufficient-the rest is worthless."
"If a man has important work, and enough leisure and income to enable him to do it properly, he is in possession of as much happiness as is good for any of the children of Adam."
"The secret of happiness ... is to be in harmony with existence, to be always calm, always lucid, always willing ""to be joined to the universe without being more conscious of it than an idiot,"" to let each wave of life wash us a little farther up the shore."
"Good friends, good books and a sleepy conscience: this is the ideal life."
"The grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do, something to love and something to hope for."
"The best philosophy is to do one's duties, to take the world as it comes, submit respectfully to one's lot, and bless the goodness that has given us so much happiness with it, whatever it is."
"One is happy as a result of one's own efforts-once one knows the necessary ingredients of happiness-simple tastes, a certain degree of courage, self-denial to a point, love of work, and, above all, a clear conscience."
"In order to be utterly happy the only thing necessary is to refrain from comparing this moment with other moments in the past, which I often did not fully enjoy because I was comparing them with other moments of the future."
"From birth to age eighteen, a girl needs good parents. From eighteen to thirty-five, she needs good looks. From thirty-five to fifty-five, she needs a good personality. From fifty-five on, she needs good cash."
"To make a man happy, fill his hands with work, his heart with affection, his mind with purpose, his memory with useful knowledge, his future with hope, and his stomach with food."
"For me, happiness came from prayer to a kindly God, faith in a kindly God, love for my fellow man, and doing the very best I could every day of my life. I had looked for happiness in fast living, but it was not there. I tried to find it in money, but it was not there, either. But when I placed myself in tune with what I believe to be fundamental truths of life, when I began to develop my limited ability, to rid my mind of all kinds of tangled thoughts and fill it with zeal and courage and love, when I gave myself a chance by treating myself decently and sensibly, I began to feel the stimulating, warm glow of happiness."
"There are three ingredients in the good life: learning, earning and yearning."
Work and love-these are the basics. Without them there is neurosis.
"If thou workest at that which is before thee ... expecting nothing, fearing nothing, but satisfied with thy present activity according to Nature, and with heroic truth in every word and sound which thou utterest, thou wilt live happy. And there is no man who is able to prevent this."
"Our greatest happiness does not depend on the condition of life in which chance has placed us, but is always the result of a good conscience, good health, occupation and freedom in all just pursuits."
"I believe the recipe for happiness to be just enough money to pay the monthly bills you acquire, a little surplus to give you confidence, a little too much work each day, enthusiasm for your work, a substantial share of good health, a couple of real friends and a wife and children to share life's beauty with you."
"If we could learn how to balance rest against effort, calmness against strain, quiet against turmoil, we would assure ourselves of joy in living and psychological health for life."
"Five great enemies to peace inhabit us: avarice, ambition, envy, anger and pride. If those enemies were to be banished, we should infallibly enjoy perpetual peace."

"May you have warmth in your igloo, oil in your lamp, and peace in your heart."
"What can be added to the happiness of man who is in health, out of debt, and has a clear conscience?"
"To do the useful thing, to say the courageous thing, to contemplate the beautiful thing: that is enough for one man's life."
"Let your boat of life be light, packed only with what you need-a homely home and simple pleasures, one or two friends worth the name, someone to love and to love you, a cat, a dog, enough to eat and enough to wear, and a little more than enough to drink, for thirst is a dangerous thing."
"To be glad of life, because it gives you the chance to love and to work and to play and to look up at the stars; to be satisfied with your possessions, but not contented with yourself until you have made the best of them; to despise nothing in the world except falsehood and meanness, and to fear nothing except cowardice; to be governed by your admirations rather than by your disgusts; to covet nothing that is your neighbor's except his kindness of heart and gentleness of manners; to think seldom of your enemies, often of your friends, and every day of Christ; and to spend as much time as you can, with body and with spirit, in God's out-of-doors- these are little guideposts on the footpath to peace."
Order your soul; reduce your wants; live in charity; associate in Christian community; obey the laws; trust in Providence.
"Simplicity, clarity, singleness: these are the attributes that give our lives power and vividness and joy."
"To live content with small means; to seek elegance rather than luxury, and refinement rather than fashion; to be worthy, not respectable, and wealthy, not rich; to study hard, think quietly, talk gently, act frankly; to listen to the stars and birds, to babes and sages, with open heart; to bear on cheerfully, do all bravely, awaiting occasions, worry never; in a word to, like the spiritual, unbidden and unconscious, grow up through the common."
"The attributes of a great lady may still be found in the rule of the four S's: Sincerity, Simplicity, Sympathy, and Serenity."
"Manifest plainness, Embrace simplicity, Reduce selfishness, Have few desires."
"Happiness comes of the capacity to feel deeply, to enjoy simply, to think freely, to risk life, to be needed."
"Fear less, hope more; eat less, chew more; whine less, breathe more; talk less, say more; love more, and all good things will be yours."
Practice easing your way along. Don't get het up or in a dither. Do your best; take it as it comes. You can handle anything if you think you can. Just keep your cool and your sense of humor.
"To live and let live, without clamor for distinction or recognition; to wait on divine Love; to write truth first on the tablet of one's own heart-this is the sanity and perfection of living, and my human ideal."
"Do all the good you can, By all the means you can, In all the ways you can, In all the places you can, At all the times you can."
"Go placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender, be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly, and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story. . . . Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labours and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world."
"Accept the pain, cherish the joys, resolve the regrets; then can come the best of benedictions-""If I had my life to live over, I'd do it all the same."""
"The way of a superior man is threefold: Virtuous, he is free from anxieties; wise, he is free from perplexities; bold, he is free from fear."
The first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit. The second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are.
"It is not easy to find happiness in ourselves, and it is not possible to find it elsewhere."
Joy is the feeling of grinning on the inside.
It is those who have a deep and real inner life who are best able to deal with the irritating details of outer life.
To live happily is an inward power of the soul.
"The secret of staying young is to live honestly, eat slowly, and lie about your age."
"Virtue, like a dowerless beauty, has more admirers than followers."
"We can build upon foundations anywhere, if they are well and truly laid."
"Though language forms the preacher, 'Tis ""good works"" make the man."

"When you're in your nineties and looking back, it's not going to be how much money you made or how many awards you've won. It's really what did you stand for. Did you make a positive difference for people?"
"For attractive lips, speak words of kindness. For lovely eyes, seek out the good in people. For a slim figure, share your food with the hungry. For beautiful hair, let a child run his or her fingers through it once a day. For poise, walk with the knowledge you'll never walk alone."
What you become is what counts.
"If an Arab in the desert were suddenly to discover a spring in his tent, and so would always be able to have water in abundance, how fortunate he would consider himself; so too, when a man who ... is always turned toward the outside, thinking that his happiness lies outside him, finally turns inward and discovers that the source is within him."
"Happiness is not in our circumstances, but in ourselves. It is not something we see, like a rainbow, or feel, like the heat of a fire. Happiness is something we are."
"Seek not outside yourself, heaven is within."
"If we have not peace within ourselves, it is in vain to seek it from outward sources."
"Most true happiness comes from one's inner life, from the disposition of the mind and soul. Admittedly, a good inner life is difficult to achieve, especially in these trying times. It takes reflection and contemplation and self-discipline."
"It's what you do that makes your soul, not the other way around."
The happiest people seem to be those who have no particular cause for being happy except that they are so.
I think the inner person is the most important. ... I would like to see an invention that keeps the mind alert. That's what is important.
"I don't think that... one gets a flash of happiness once, and never again; it is there within you, and it will come as certainly as death."
"There is no other solution to man's progress but the day's honest work, the day's honest decisions, the day's generous utterances, and the day's good deed."
You have much more power when you are working for the right thing than when you are working for the wrong thing.
"I am convinced that we must train not only the head, but the heart and hand as well."
"Live virtuously, and you cannot die too soon, or live too long."
A happy life is one which is in accordance with its own nature.
"People see God every day, they just don't recognize Him."
"We hear voices in solitude, we never hear in the hurry and turmoil of life; we receive counsels and comforts we get under no other condition."
"Happiness is not a possession to be prized, it is a quality of thought, a state of mind."
"Happiness is a butterfly which, when pursued, is always beyond our grasp, but, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you."
Happiness is something that comes into our lives through doors we don't even remember leaving open.
"To seek after beauty as an end, is a wild goose chase, a will-o'-the-wisp, because it is to misunderstand the very nature of beauty, which is the normal condition of a thing being as it should be."
Perfect happiness is the absence of striving for happiness.

"Those who seek happiness miss it, and those who discuss it, lack it."
Inspiration never arrived when you were searching for it.
Nothing is more hopeless than a scheme of merriment.
Happiness is never stopping to think if you are.
"It is the paradox of life that the way to miss pleasure is to seek it first. The very first condition of lasting happiness is that a life should be full of purpose, aiming at something outside self."
If you pursue happiness you'll never find it.
Some of us might find happiness if we quit struggling so desperately for it.
"Seek not happiness too greedily, and be not fearful of unhappiness."
"The man of pleasure, by a vain attempt to be more happy than any man can be, is often more miserable than most men."
The bird of paradise alights only on the hand that does not grasp.
The only way to happiness is never to give happiness a thought.
"Everyone chases after happiness, not noticing that happiness is at their heels."
"Seek to do good, and you will find that happiness will run after you."
Deliberately to pursue happiness is not the surest way of achieving it. Seek it for its own sake and I doubt whether you will find it.
"Enjoyment is not a goal, it is a feeling that accompanies important ongoing activity."
If only we'd stop trying to be happy we'd have a pretty good time.
Most men pursue pleasure with such breathless haste that they hurry past it.
"Happiness comes most to persons who seek it least, and think least about it. It is not an object to be sought, it is a state to be induced. It must follow and not lead. It must overtake you, and not you overtake it."
Happiness sneaks in through a door you didn't know you left open.
"Happiness is like a cat. If you try to coax it or call it, it will avoid you. It will never come. But if you pay no attention to it and go about your business, you'll find it rubbing against your legs and jumping into your lap."
One must never look for happiness: one meets it by the way.
They seemed to come suddenly upon happiness as if they had surprised a butterfly in the winter woods.
"Happiness in this world, when it comes, comes incidentally. Make it the object of pursuit, and it leads us on a wild-goose chase, and is never attained. Follow some other object, and very possibly we may find that we have caught happiness without dreaming of it."
Happiness and beauty are by-products. Folly is the direct pursuit of happiness and beauty.
It is the very pursuit of happiness that thwarts happiness.
"If you ever find happiness by hunting for it, you will find it, as the old woman did her lost spectacles, safe on her nose all the time."

Happiness is mostly a by-product of doing what makes us feel fulfilled.
Happiness is something you get as a by-product in the process of making something else.
"Happiness is not a horse, you cannot harness it."

That kind of life is most happy which affords us most opportunities of gaining our own esteem.
"Happiness is not something you get, but something you do."
Happiness is action.
I am enjoying to a full that period of reflection which is the happiest conclusion to a life of action.
"Action may not always bring happiness, but there is no happiness without action."
"I want a busy life, a just mind, and a timely death."
Happiness is often the result of being too busy to be miserable.
Painting's not important. The important thing is keeping busy.
"To attain happiness in another world we need only to believe something; to secure it in this world, we must do something."
"To fill the hour, and leave no crevice ... that is happiness."
"If you observe a really happy man, you will find ... that he is happy in the course of living life twenty-four crowded hours of each day."

The formula for complete happiness is to be very busy.
The busiest man is the happiest man.
To be busy is man's only happiness.
The only way to avoid being miserable is not to have enough leisure to wonder whether you are happy or not.

"This is true joy of life-being used for a purpose that is recognized by yourself as a mighty one ... instead of being a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances, complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy."
Never mind your happiness; do your duty.
Human happiness and moral duty are inseparably connected.
"When we ... devote ourselves to the strict and unsparing performance of duty, then happiness comes of itself."
"Seek happiness for its own sake, and you will not find it; seek for duty, and happiness will follow as the shadow comes with the sunshine."

The only true happiness comes from squandering ourselves for a purpose.
Happiness is the natural flower of duty.
The happiest excitement in life is to be convinced that one is fighting for all one is worth on behalf of some clearly seen and deeply felt good.
"True happiness, we are told, consists in getting out of one's self. But the point is not only to get out, you must stay out. And to stay out, you must have some absorbing errand."

There is nothing like staying at home for real comfort.
I don't think about whether people will remember me or not. I've been an okay person. I've learned a lot. I've taught people a thing or two. That's what's important.
"What would life be without art? Science prolongs life. To consist of what-eating, drinking, and sleeping? What is the good of living longer if it is only a matter of satisfying the requirements that sustain life? All this is nothing without the charm of art."
It is by studying little things that we attain the great knowledge of having as little misery and as much happiness as possible.

Moderation. Small helpings. Sample a little bit of everything. These are the secrets of happiness and good health.
"The best things are nearest: breath in your nostrils, light in your eyes, flowers at your feet, duties at your hand, the path of God just before you.

"For most of life, nothing wonderful happens. If you don't enjoy getting up and working and finishing your work and sitting down to a meal with family or friends, then the chances are you're not going to be very happy. If someone bases his happiness or unhappiness on major events like a great new job, huge amounts of money, a flawlessly happy marriage or a trip to Paris, that person isn't going to be happy much of the time. If, on the other hand, happiness depends on a good breakfast, flowers in the yard, a drink or a nap, then we are more likely to live with quite a bit of happiness."
The mere sense of living is joy enough.
The true way to soften one's troubles is to solace those of others.

The nice thing about teamwork is that you always have others on your side.
No one can sincerely try to help another without helping himself.

You can always trust information given you by people who are crazy; they have an access to truth not available through regular channels.

I wish everybody would go back into the closet.
"It is in vain to hope to please all alike. Let a man stand with his face in what direction he will, he must necessarily turn his back on one half of the world."
Modern dancers give a sinister portent about our times. The dancers don't even look at one another. They are just a lot of isolated individuals jiggling in a kind of self-hypnosis and dancing with others only to remind themselves that we are not completely alone in this world.
One kind word can warm three winter months.
"Outside, among your fellows, among strangers, you must preserve appearances, 100 things you cannot do; but inside, the terrible freedom!"
"The easiest kind of relationship for me is with 10,000 people. The hardest is with one."
"The opinions which we hold of one another, our relations with friends and kinsfolk are in no sense permanent, save in appearance, but are as eternally fluid as the sea itself."
The ultimate indignity is to be given a bedpan by a stranger who calls you by your first name.
"There is no society or conversation to be kept up in the world without good nature, or something which must bear its appearance and supply its place. For this reason, mankind have been forced to invent a kind of artificial humanity, which is what we express by the word Good Breeding."
"When the man is at home, his standing in society is well known and quietly taken; but when he is abroad, it is problematical, and is dependent on the success of his manners."
"When you live next to the cemetery, you cannot weep for everyone."
"Almost all of our relationships begin, and most of them continue, as forms of mutual exploitation, a mental or physical barter, to be terminated when one or both parties run out of goods."
"When you meet anyone in the flesh you realize immediately that he is a human being and not a sort of caricature embodying certain ideas. It is partly for this reason that I don't mix much in literary circles, because I know from experience that once I have met and spoken to anyone I shall never again be able to feel any intellectual brutality towards him, even when I feel I ought to - like the Labour M.P.s who get patted on the back by dukes and are lost forever more."
"The wisest man I have ever known once said to me: 'Nine out of every ten people improve on acquaintance,' and I have found his words true."

"At the heart of our friendly or purely social relations, there lurks a hostility momentarily cured but recurring in fits and starts."
"The worst sin towards our fellow creatures is not to hate them, but to be indifferent to them; that's the essence of inhumanity."
We rarely confide in those who are better than we are.
"A sense of duty is useful in work, but offensive in personal relations. People wish to be liked, not be endured with patient resignation."
The fact is that the possession of a highly social conscience about large-scale issues is no guarantee whatever of reasonable conduct in private relations.
With three or more people there is something bold in the air: direct things get said which would frighten two people alone and conscious of each inch of their nearness to one another. To be three is to be in public - you feel safe.
"Acquaintance, n: a person whom we know well enough to borrow from, but not well enough to lend to."
"In any relationship we feel an unconscious need to create, as it were, a new picture, a new edition of ourselves to present to the fresh person who claims our interest; for them, we in a strange sense wish to, and do, start life anew."
Make yourself necessary to somebody.
Only the person who has faith in himself is able to be faithful to others.
We accept every person in the world as that for which he gives himself out; only he must give himself out for something. We can put up with the unpleasant more easily than we can endure the insignificant.
"Each of us keeps, battened down inside himself, a sort of lunatic giant -impossible socially, but full-scale. It's the knockings and batterings we sometimes hear in each other that keep our intercourse from utter banality."
"We wander through this life together in a semi-darkness in which none of us can distinguish exactly the features of his neighbour. Only from time to time, through some experience that we have of our companion, or through some remark that he passes, he stands for a moment close to us, as though illuminated by a flash of lightning. Then we see him as he really is."
A loving person lives in a loving world. A hostile person lives in a hostile world: everyone you meet is your mirror.
It is always safe to assume that people are more subtle and less sensitive than they seem.
"I was born modest; not all over, but in spots."
A modest man is usually admired - if people ever hear of him.

"If you treat men the way they are you never improve them. If you treat them the way you want them to be, you do."

"The more you let yourself go, the less others let you go."
"A hundred times every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life depend on the labours of other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received."
"At bottom the world isn't a joke. We only joke about it to avoid an issue with someone, to let someone know that we know he's there with his questions; to disarm him by seeming to have heard and done justice to his side of the standing argument."
"I reckon there's as much human nature in some folks as there is in others, if not more."
"If only there were evil people somewhere, insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?"
Science may have found a cure for most evils: but it has found no remedy for the worst of them all - the apathy of human beings.
The go-between wears out a thousand sandals.
Life is livable because we know that wherever we go most of the people we meet will be restrained in their actions toward us by an almost instinctive network of taboos.
"I was taught when I was young that if people would only love one another, all would be well with the world. This seemed simple and very nice; but I found when I tried to put it in practice not only that other people were seldom lovable, but that I was not very lovable myself."
"It is well to remember that the entire population of the universe, with one trifling exception, is composed of others."
Our concern is not how to worship in the catacombs but how to remain human in the skyscrapers.

I love my country better than my family; but I love humanity better than my country.

If put to a pinch, an ounce of loyalty is worth a pound of cleverness. If you must vilify, condemn and eternally disparage - resign your position, and when you are on the outside, damn to your heart's content, but as long as you are part of the institution do not condemn it."

In a war of ideas it is people who get killed.
"To say that an idea is fashionable is to say, I think, that it has been adulterated to a point where it is hardly an idea at all."

The true test of character is ... how we behave when we don't know what to do.
"Nothing in this world can one imagine beforehand, not the least thing. Everything is made up of so many unique particulars that cannot be foreseen."
The work will teach you how to do it.
"Life is my college. May I graduate well, and earn some honors!"
"Living is a form of not being sure, not knowing what next or how. The moment you know how, you begin to die a little. The artist never entirely knows. We guess. We may be wrong, but we take leap after leap in the dark."
"Where there is an unknowable, there is a promise."
I am not ashamed to confess that I am ignorant of wha. I do not know.
Ignorance never settles a question.
"Where ignorance is bliss, Tis folly to be wise."
"Magic lives in curves, not angles."
Nothing is more sad than the death of an illusion.
"As I was going up the stair I met a man who wasn't there. He wasn't there again today. I wish, I wish, he'd stay away."
The task of the real intellectual consists of analyzing illusions in order to discover their causes.
An illusion which makes me happy is worth a verity which drags me to the ground.
"We must select the illusion which appeals to our temperament, and embrace it with passion, if we want to be happy."
Winston Churchill is always expecting rabbits to come out of an empty hat.
"Reputation is an idle and most false imposition; oft got without merit, and lost without deserving."
Every real object must cease to be what it seemed and none could ever be what the whole soul desired.
"Aspects are within us, and who seems most kingly is king."
Those who lose dreaming are lost.
"It is dangerous to let the public behind the scenes. They are easily disillusioned and then they are angry with you, for it was the illusion they loved."
"A rock pile ceases to be a rock pile the moment a single man contemplates it, bearing within him the image of a cathedral."
"Ever let the Fancy roam, Pleasure never is at home."
"Fools act on imagination without knowledge, pedants act on knowledge without imagination."
"From ghoulies and ghosties and long-leggedy beasties And things that go bump in the night, good Lord, deliver us!"
"I admit that twice two makes four is an excellent thing, but if we are to give everything its due, twice two makes five is sometimes a very charming thing too."
Inspiration could be called inhaling the memory of an act never experienced.
"It was a year when Frankie thought about the world. And she did not see it as a round school globe, with the countries neat and different-coloured. She thought of the world as huge and cracked and loose and turning a thousand miles an hour."
Saddle your dreams afore you ride 'em.
The eyes are not responsible when the mind does the seeing.
"Were it not for imagination, a man would be as happy in the arms of a chambermaid as of a duchess."
"Imagination grows by exercise, and contrary to common belief, is more powerful in the mature than in the young."
"The imagination of a boy is healthy, and the mature imagination of a man is healthy, but there is a space of life between, in which the soul is in ferment, the character undecided, the way of life uncertain."
"His imagination resembled the wings of an ostrich. It enabled him to run, though not to soar."
Imagination is the eye of the soul.
Imagination is a poor substitute for experience.
"Imagination frames events unknown, In wild, fantastic shapes of hideous ruin, And what it fears, creates."
"Reason respects the differences, and imagination the similitudes of things."
The sky is the daily bread of the eyes.
Let us leave pretty women to men without imagination.
"To make a prairie it takes clover and one bee one clover, and a bee, and revery The revery alone will do, if bees are few."
The value of a sentiment is the amount of sacrifice you are prepared to make for it.
"It is good to know the truth, but it is better to speak of palm trees."
Imagination is more important than knowledge.
Imagination is the eye of the soul.
He who has imagination without learning has wings but no feet.
The human race is governed by its imagination.
"Imagination disposes of everything; it creates beauty, justice, and happiness, which is everything in this world."
"Most people go on living their everyday life: frightened, half indifferent, they behold the ghostly tragi-comedy that has been performed on the international stage before the eyes and ears of the world."
"We are, in truth, more than a half of what we are by imitation."
"When people are free to do as they please, they usually imitate each other."
Almost all absurdity of conduct arises from the imitation of those whom we cannot resemble.
There is a difference between imitating a good man and counterfeiting him.
Every man is a borrower and a mimic; life is theatrical and literature a quotation.
"We do not imitate, but are a model to others."
The crow that mimics a cormorant gets drowned.
"We love in others what we lack ourselves, and would be everything but what we are."
Immature poets imitate: mature poets steal.
"Agesilaus, the Spartan king, was once invited to hear a mimic imitate the nightingale, but declined with the comment that he had heard the nightingale itself."
Fewer things are harder to put up with than the annoyance of a good example.
Imitation is the sincerest (form) of flattery.
It is impossible to imitate Voltaire without being Voltaire.
"He who imitates what is evil always goes beyond the example that is set; on the contrary, he who imitates what is good always falls short."
A good imitation is the most perfect originality.
What is human is immortal!
A good man never dies.
"I have been dying for twenty years, now I am going to live."
Immortality is the glorious discovery of Christianity.
Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was; and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.
"Oh, may I join the choir invisible Of those immortal dead who live again."
Life is the childhood of our immortality.
"The nearer I approach the end, the plainer I hear around me the immortal symphonies of the worlds which invite me. It is marvelous, yet simple."
"Our hope of immortality does not come from any religion, but nearly all religions come from that hope."
I wish to believe in immortality - I wish to live with you forever.
No one could ever meet death for his country without the hope of immortality.
There is no death! the stars go down to rise upon some fairer shore.
"For tho' from out our bourne of time and place The flood may bear me far, I hope to see my Pilot face to face When I have crost the bar."
Never did Christ utter a single word attesting to a personal resurrection and a life beyond the grave.
The mission of the United States is one of benevolent assimilation.
Take up the white man's burden -  Send forth the best ye breed -  Go bind your sons to exile To serve your captives' need.
"The conquest of the earth, which mostly means the taking it away from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter noses than ourselves, is not a pretty thing when you look into it."
You cannot make a crab walk straight.
You can't get blood out of a turnip.
You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.
Few things are impossible to diligence and skill.
Never let me hear that foolish word again.
Impossible is a word only to be found in the dictionary of fools.
To the timid and hesitating everything is impossible because it seems so.
It is necessary to try to surpass one's self always; this occupation ought to last as long as life.
People seldom improve when they have no other model but themselves to copy after.
Slumber not in the tents of your fathers. The world is advancing. Advance with it!
I never thrust my nose into other men's porridge. It is no bread and butter of mine: Every man for himself and God for us all.
"Can anything be so elegant as to have few wants, and to serve them one's self?"
"Voyager upon life's sea: -  To yourself be true, And whate'er your lot may be, Paddle your own canoe."
"I would rather sit on a pumpkin, and have it all to myself, than to be crowded on a velvet cushion."
Lack of something to feel important about is almost the greatest tragedy a man may have.
There is nothing harder than the softness of indifference.
"Communists have committed great crimes, but at least they have not stood aside, like an established society, and been indifferent. I would rather have blood on my hands than water, like Pilate."
Hate is not the opposite of love; apathy is.
What makes life dreary is want of motive.
"The hottest places in hell are reserved for those who, in time of great moral crisis, maintain their neutrality."
"Once conform, once do what others do because they do it, and a kind of lethargy steals over all the finer senses of the soul."
"Not to he who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to he who does not concern us at all."
"Most of us have no real loves and no real hatreds. Blessed is love, less blessed is hatred, but thrice accursed is that indifference which is neither one nor the other."
The only menace is inertia.
"Tolerance is a tremendous virtue, but the immediate neighbours of tolerance are apathy and weakness."
"The true opposite of love is not hate but indifference. Hate, bad as it is, at least treats the neighbour as a thou, whereas indifference turns the neighbour into an it, a thing. This is why we may say that there is actually one thing worse than evil itself and that is indifference to evil. In human relations the nadir of morality, the lowest point as far as Christian ethics is concerned, is manifest in the phrase, T couldn't care less.'"
"If moderation is a fault, then indifference is a crime."
"Indifference may not wreck a man's life at any one turn, but it will destroy him with a kind of dry-rot in the long run."
An institution is the lengthened shadow of one man.
"Every individual has a place to fill in the world, and is important in some respect, whether he chooses to be so or not."
"The worth of a state, in the long run, is the worth of the individuals composing it."
"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might."
"The more we do, the more we can do; the more busy we are, the more leisure we have."
"In this theater of man's life, it is reserved only for God and angels to be lookers on."
I am a part of all that I have met.
"The humblest individual exerts some influence, either for good or evil, upon others."
A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
A woman is more influenced by what she divines than by what she is told.
"If the nose of Cleopatra had been shorter, the whole face of the earth would have been changed."
"Thou wert my guide, philosopher, and friend."
We set ourselves to bite the hand that feeds us.
Brutes leave ingratitude to man.
"This was the most unkindest cut of all; For when the noble Caesar saw him stab, Ingratitude, more strong than traitor's arm, Quite vanquish'd him; then burst his mighty heart."
"Do you know what is more hard to bear than the reverses of fortune? It is the baseness, the hideous ingratitude, of man."
The injury we do and the one we suffer are not weighed in the same scales.
"Recompense injury with justice, and recompense kindness with kindness."
"If the other person injures you, you may forget the injury; but if you injure him you will always remember."
In an injury has to be done to a man it should be so severe that his vengeance need not be feared.
There is no ghost so difficult to lay as the ghost of an injury.
"There is but one blasphemy, and that is injustice."
He who commits injustice is ever made more wretched than he who suffers it.
"When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying ""I am innocent of the blood of this just person: See to it."" Then answered all the people, and said ""His blood be on us, and on our children."""
"The truly innocent are those who not only are guiltless themselves, but who think others are."
The innocent is the person who explains nothing.
Whoever blushes is already guilty; true innocence is ashamed of nothing.
Through our own recovered innocence we discern the innocence of our neighbours.
As innocent as a new-laid egg.
"Had laws not been, we never had been blam'd; For not to know we sinn'd is innocence."
Good is when I steal other people's wives and cattle; bad is when they steal mine.
It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer.
As innocent as a new-laid egg.
They that know no evil will suspect none.
Innocence finds not near so much protection as guilt.
No excellent soul is exempt from a mixture of madness.
Mad as a March hare.
I teach that all men are mad.
"Insanity in individuals is something rare - but in groups, parties, nations, and epochs it is the ru)e."
"That he is mad, 'tis true; 'tis true 'tis pity; And pity 'tis 'tis true."
Whom Jupiter would destroy he first drives mad.
"Though this be madness, yet there is method in 't."
No man was ever great without a touch of divine afflatus.
A writer is rarely so well inspired as when he talks about himself.
Inspiration and genius - one and the same.
"Every true man, sir, who is a little above the level of the beasts and plants, lives so as to give a meaning and a value to his own life."
Never let go of that fiery sadness called desire.
For every man there exists a bait which he cannot resist swallowing.
"The moment somebody says to me, ""This is very risky,"" is the moment it becomes attractive to me."
"Discontent is the first step in progress. No one knows what is in him till he tries, and many would never try if they were not forced to."
"All progress is based upon a universal, innate desire on the part of every living organism to live beyond its income."
"It is the spur of ignorance, the consciousness of not understanding, and the curiosity about that which lies beyond that are essential to our progress."
One starts an action simply because one must do something.
"What you are must always displease you, if you would attain to that which you are not."
"If you're good to your staff when things are going well, they'll rally when times go bad."
"Praise out of season, or tactlessly bestowed, can freeze the heart as much as blame."
The pitcher cries for water to carry and a person for work that is real.
Beware of trying to accomplish anything by force.

"Trust your own instinct. Your mistakes might as well be your own, instead of someone else's."
"I feel there are two people inside of me-me and my intuition. If I go against her, she'll screw me every time, and if I follow her, we get along quite nicely."
"I give myself, sometimes, admirable advice, but I am incapable of taking it."
Some of the finest moral intuitions come to quite humble people. The visiting of lofty ideas doesn't depend on formal schooling. Think of those Galilean peasants.
"I'm the foe of moderation, the champion of excess. If I may lift a line from a die-hard whose identity is lost in the shuffle, ""I'd rather be strongly wrong than weakly right."""
Conviction without experiences makes for harshness.
Without fanaticism we cannot accomplish anything.
To have character is to be big enough to take life on.
The trouble is that not enough people have come together with the firm determination to live the things which they say they believe.
"All I can do is act according to my deepest instinct, and be whatever I must be-crazy or ribald or sad or compassionate or loving or indifferent. That is all anybody can do."
Instinct is untaught ability.
Trusting our intuition often saves us from disaster.
Trust your gut.
It is our business to go as we are impelled.
Intuition ... appears to be the extrasensory perception of reality.
Common sense is instinct. Enough of it is genius.
A goose flies by a chart which the Royal Geographical Society could not improve.
I go by instinct. ... I don't worry about experience.
"Unconsciousness, spontaneity, instinct ... hold us to the earth and dictate the relatively good and useful."
"Every time you don't follow your inner guidance, you feel a loss of energy, loss of power, a sense of spiritual deadness."
"Every time a resolve or fine glow of feeling evaporates without bearing fruit, it is worse than a chance lost; it works to hinder future emotions from taking the normal path of discharge."
It is only by following your deepest instinct that you can lead a rich life.
Instinct is the nose of the mind.
"One of the reasons why so few of us ever act, instead of react, is because we are continually stifling our deepest impulses."
"A man should not strive to eliminate his complexes but to get into accord with them, for they are legitimately what directs his conduct in the world."
"If you let your fear of consequence prevent you from following your deepest instinct, your life will be safe, expedient and thin."
Everyone was searching for a formula for survival... and the only formula that worked was no formula. Instinct ... that's all you had to go on.
"I feel there are two people inside me-me and my intuition. If I go against her, she'll screw me every time, and if I follow her, we get along quite nicely."
To be faithful to your instincts and the impulses that carry you in the direction of the excellence you most desire and value ... surely that is to lead the noble life.
"We each need to let our intuition guide us, and then be willing to follow that guidance directly and fearlessly."
"By learning to contact, listen to, and act on our intuition, we can directly connect to the higher power of the universe and allow it to become our guiding force."
"The struggle to learn to listen to and respect our own intuitive, inner promptings is the greatest challenge of all."
"Once you get rid of the idea that you must please other people before you please yourself, and you begin to follow your own instincts-only then can you be successful. You become more satisfied, and when you are, other people tend to be satisfied by what you do."
"If you do not express your own original ideas, if you do not listen to your own being, you will have betrayed yourself."
"Every human being has, like Socrates, an attendant spirit; and wise are they who obey its signals. If it does not always tell us what to do, it always cautions us what not to do."
"Trust the instinct to the end, though you can render no reason."
"The truth of a thing is the feel of it, not the think of it."
Spend time every day listening to what your muse is trying to tell you.
"When I do things without any explanation, but just with spontaneity ... I can be sure that I am right."
Analysis kills spontaneity. The grain once ground into flour germinates no more.
"Spontaneity is the quality of being able to do something just because you feel like it at the moment, of trusting your instincts, of taking yourself by surprise and snatching from the clutches of your well-organized routine a bit of unscheduled pleasure."
"I never believe facts; Canning said nothing was so fallacious as facts, except figures."
Trust your hunches. ... Hunches are usually based on facts filed away just below the conscious level. Warning! Do not confuse your hunches with wishful thinking. This is the road to disaster.
"Facts are not truths; they are not conclusions; they are not even premisses, but in the nature and parts of premisses."
Statistics are no substitute for judgement.
You cannot know what you cannot feel.
"We should chiefly depend not upon that department of the soul which is most superficial and fallible (our reason), but upon that department that is deep and sure, which is instinct."
I make all my decisions on intuition. I throw a spear into the darkness. That is intuition. Then I must send an army into the darkness to find the spear. That is intellect.
Instinct is intelligence incapable of self-consciousness.
"Every advance in social progress removes us more and more from the guidance of instinct, obliging us to depend upon reason for the assurance that our habits are really agreeable to the laws of health."
Follow your instincts. That's where true wisdom manifests itself.
"Impulse without reason is not enough, and reason without impulse is a poor makeshift."
"The shrewd guess, the fertile hypothesis, the courageous leap to a tentative conclusion-these are the most valuable coin of the thinker at work."
"A trembling in the bones may carry a more convincing testimony than the dry, documented deductions of the brain."
Calculation never made a hero.
We are so clothed in rationalization and dissemblance that we can recognize but dimly the deep primal impulses that motivate us.
All our reasoning ends in surrender to feeling.
"Reason, ruling alone, is a force confining; and passion, unattended, is a flame that burns to its own destruction."
Modern man's besetting temptation is to sacrifice his direct perceptions and spontaneous feelings to his reasoned reflections; to prefer in all circumstances the verdict of his intellect to that of his immediate intuitions.
"Decisions, particularly important ones, have always made me sleepy, perhaps because I know that I will have to make them by instinct, and thinking things out is only what other people tell me I should do."
Systems die; instincts remain.
"I do not believe that the deeper problems of living can ever be answered by the process of thought. I believe that life itself teaches us either patience with regard to them, or reveals to us possible solutions when our hearts are pressed close against duties and sorrows and experiences of all kinds."
"Life is one long struggle between conclusions based on abstract ways of conceiving cases, and opposite conclusions prompted by our instinctive perception of them."
Nothing reaches the intellect before making its appearance in the senses.
"Instinct guides the animal better than the man. In the animal it is pure, in man it is led astray by his reason and intelligence."
"Ideas pull the trigger, but instinct loads the gun."
Well-bred instinct meets reason halfway.
Good instincts usually tell you what to do long before your head has figured it out.
Pure logic is the ruin of the spirit.
"When a man begins to reason, he ceases to feel."
A mind all logic is like a knife all blade. It makes the hand bleed that uses it.
"The mind can assert anything, and pretend it has proved it. My beliefs I test on my body, on my intuitional consciousness, and when I get a response there, then I accept."
People who lean on logic and philosophy and rational exposition end by starving the best part of the mind.
"The brain is not, and cannot be, the sole or complete organ of thought and feeling."
Imagination is more important than knowledge.
Some other faculty than the intellect is necessary for the apprehension of reality.
"Command by instinct is swifter, subtler, deeper, more accurate, more in touch with reality than command by conscious mind. The discovery takes one's breath away."
No one is more liable to make mistakes than the man who acts only on reflection.
"Nothing is impossible when we follow our inner guidance, even when its direction may threaten us by reversing our usual logic."
A true history of human events would show that a far larger proportion of our acts are the results of sudden impulses and accident than of that reason of which we so much boast.
It is wisdom to believe the heart.
"I follow my heart, for I can trust it."
The intellect is always fooled by the heart.
There are no rules. Just follow your heart.
"Man becomes man only by his intelligence, but he is man only by his heart."
"It is the heart always that sees, before the head can see."
It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.
Great thoughts always come from the heart.
"It is the heart which experiences God, not the reason."
The heart has reasons which reason cannot understand.
"In making our decisions, we must use the brains that God has given us. But we must also use our hearts, which He also gave us."
Just be what you are and speak from your guts and heart-it's all a man has.
"When love is not madness, it is not love."
"To live is like to love: all reason is against it, and all healthy instinct is for it."
"The thinker philosophizes as the lover loves. Even were the consequences not only useless but harmful, he must obey his impulse."
"What you intuitively desire, that is possible to you."
"Falling in love is one of the activities forbidden that tiresome person, the consistently reasonable man."
If you really want something you can figure out how to make it happen.
Our real duty is always found running in the direction of our worthiest desires.
"The essential conditions of everything you do must be choice, love, passion."
"Passion and prejudice govern the world, only under the name of reason."
The conclusions of passion are the only reliable ones.
"Man is a passion which brings a will into play, which works an intelligence."
"Life is not governed by will or intention. Life is a question of nerves, and fibers, and slowly built-up cells in which thought hides itself, and passion has its dreams."
We do not wish ardently for what we desire only through reason.
Trust your hunches. They're usually based on facts filed away just below the conscious level.
"Inspiration does not come like a bolt, nor is it kinetic energy striving, but it comes to us slowly and quietly and all the time."

He knows that good is better than evil, that confidence should supersede fear, that love is superior to hate, that gentleness is better than cruelty, forbearance than intolerance, compassion than arrogance, and that truth has more virtue than ignorance."
One of the functions of intelligence is to take account of the dangers that come from trusting solely to the intelligence.

I was like that ship before my education began, only I was without compass or sounding line, and no way of knowing how near the harbor was. ""Light! Give me light!"" was the wordless cry of my soul, and rhe light of love shone on me in that very hour."

All this will not be finished in the first 100 days. Nor will it be finished in the first 1,000 days, nor in the life of this administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But let us begin. Now the trumpet summons us again - not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need - not as a call to battle, though embattled we are - but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, ""rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation""- a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease and war itself. And so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country . My fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man."

"The world must be made safe for democracy. Its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty. We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no conquest, no domination.

We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and freedom of nations can make them."

Neither be cynical about love - for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labours and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world."

Life is one long process of getting tired.
He who has a why to live can bear with almost any how.
"Oh, how daily life is. (Ah, que la vie est quotidienne.)"
Death and taxes and childbirth. There's never any convenient time for any of them.
We're all in this together - by ourselves.
"Normal day, let me be aware of the treasure you are. Let me learn from you, love you, savour you, bless you before you depart. Let me not pass you by in quest of some rare and perfect tomorrow. Let me hold you while I may, for it will not always be so. One day I shall dig my nails into the earth, or bury my face in the pillow, or stretch myself taut, or raise my hands to the sky, and want, more than all the world, your return."
A proverb is no proverb to you till life has illustrated it.

The one thing we can never get enough of is love. And the one thing we never give enough of is love.
"There can be no peace of mind in love, since the advantage one has secured is never anything by a fresh starting-point for further desires."
"What I cannot love, I overlook."
"A loving relationship is one in which the loved one is free to be himself - to laugh with me, but never at me; to cry with me, but never because of me; to love life, to love himself, to love being loved. Such a relationship is based upon freedom and can never grow in a jealous heart."
Love is a canvas furnished by nature and embroidered by imagination.
Love is the only sane and satisfactory answer to the problem of human existence.
We are all born for love; it is the principle of existence and its only end.
"Love is the only thing that we can carry with us when we go, and it makes the end so easy."

Love is ever the beginning of Knowledge as fire is of light.
Life in common among people who love each other is the ideal of happiness.
"I wonder what memories of yours will persist as you go on in life. My hunch is that the most important will have to do with feelings of loving and being loved - whoever's been close to you. As you continue to grow, you'll find many ways of expressing your love and you'll discover more and more ways in which others express their love for you."
"Where love is, no room is too small."

"It is love, not reason, that is stronger than death."

"Love your neighbor as yourself, but don't take down the fence."
There is no better exercise for strengthening the heart than reaching down and lifting up another.
Love does not dominate; it cultivates.

Ofttimes the test of courage becomes rather to live than to die.
Every man's life is a fairy-tale written by God's fingers.
Life is a jig saw puzzle with most of the pieces missing.

Christian life consists in faith and charity.
Strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life.
"My candle burns at both ends; It will not last the night; But, ah, my foes, and, oh, my friends -  It gives a lovely light."

The one important thing I have learned over the years is the difference between taking one's work seriously and taking one's self seriously. The first is imperative and the second is disastrous.

There is no cure for birth or death save to enjoy the interval.
"Life's better when it's fun. Boy, that's deep, isn't it?"
"When a man is gloomy, everything seems to go wrong; when he is cheerful, everything seems right!"
An ounce of cheerfulness is worth a pound of sadness to serve God with.
Years back someone said cod liver oil was the cure-all! Cheerfulness is more palliative and with no unpleasant aftertaste.
"Cheerfulness keeps up a kind of daylight in the mind, filling it with a steady and perpetual serenity."
"The highest wisdom is continual cheerfulness; such a state, like the region above the moon, is always clear and serene."
"Let us be of good cheer, remembering that misfortunes hardest to bear are those which never come."
Burdens become light when cheerfully borne.
A happy woman is one who has no cares at all; a cheerful woman is one who has cares but doesn't let them get her down.
Even if we can't be happy we must always be cheerful.
"Nature intended you to be the fountain-spring of cheerfulness and social life, and not the mountain of despair and melancholy."
You find yourself refreshed by the presence of cheerful people. Why not make an earnest effort to confer that pleasure on others? Half the battle is gained if you never allow yourself to say anything gloomy.
"Cheerfulness is contagious, but don't wait to catch it from others. Be a carrier."
"If God came in and said, ""I want you to be happy for the rest of your life,"" what would you do?"
"True happiness is to understand our duties toward God and man; to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence on the future; not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears, but to rest satisfied with what we have, which is abundantly sufficient."
"Many people think that if they were only in some other place, or had some other job, they would be happy. Well, that is doubtful. So get as much happiness out of what you are doing as you can and don't put off being happy until some future date."
You're happiest while you're making the greatest contribution.
The happiest and most contented people are those who each day perform to make the best of their abilities.
None but those who are happy in themselves can make others so.
Do you want a world with . . . more joy and happiness? Then find your own joy and happiness and contribute to the joy and happiness of others.
One thing I know; the only ones among you who will be really happy are those who will have sought and found how to serve.
Happiness is a perfume which you cannot pour on someone without getting some on yourself.
Remember that happiness is as contagious as gloom. It should be the first duty of those who are happy to let others know of their gladness.
Those who are happiest are those who do the most for others.
"Make people happy and there will not be half the quarreling, or a tenth part of the wickedness there now is."
"Lead the life that will make you kindly and friendly to everyone about you, and you will be surprised what a happy life you will lead."
"If you want to be happy, set yourself a goal that commands your thoughts, liberates your energy, and inspires your hopes. Happiness is within you. It comes from doing some certain thing into which you can put all your thought and energy. If you want to be happy, get enthusiastic about something."
Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort.
"The way to happiness: keep your heart free from hate, your mind from worry. Live simply, expect little, give much. Fill your life with love. Scatter sunshine. Forget self, think of others. Do as you would be done by. Try this for a week and you will be surprised."
"The happiness of life is made up of minute fractions - the little, soon-forgotten charities of a kiss or smile, a kind look, a heartfelt compliment, and the countless infinitesimals of pleasurable and genial feeling."
"A happy life is made up of little things . . . a gift sent, a letter written, a call made, a recommendation given, transportation provided, a cake made, a book lent, a check sent."
"Do not worry; eat three square meals a day; say your prayers; be courteous to your creditors; keep your digestion good; exercise; go slow and easy. Maybe there are other things your special case requires to make you happy, but my friend, these I reckon will give you a good life."
"The secret of happiness is this: Let your interests be as wide as possible, and let your reactions to the things and persons that interest you be as far as possible friendly rather than hostile."

But what is happiness except the simple harmony between a man and the life he leads.
"We all have 100% to deal with in our lives: 10% is important, 90% unimportant. The secret to a happy, productive life is to deal with the 10% and let the 90% slip."
"With a little discipline and regular self-checks, you can learn to do one thing at a time. And do it better. And be happier doing it."
"I've been riding the carousel in Central Park since I was five years old . . . If I'm very depressed or if something's bothering me today, my husband, Larry, and I go back to the park. We get on the carousel horse and we start riding, and I start singing at the top of my lungs. It is pure and absolute joy and happiness."
It's never too late to have a happy childhood.
"Life holds so much, so much to be happy about always. Most people ask for happiness on condition. Happiness can be felt only if you don't set any conditions."
"Happiness is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love, grace, and gratitude."
Better to be happy than wise.
"Happiness is a butterfly, which, when pursued, is always just beyond your grasp, but which, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you."
"Your success and happiness lie in you. Resolve to keep happy, and your joy and you shall form an invisible host against difficulties."
"Remember that happiness is a way of travel, not a destination."
"When ill luck besets us, to ease the tension we have only to remember that happiness is relative. The next time you are tempted to grumble about what has happened to you, why not pause and be glad that it is no worse than it is?"
"When one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us."
I have found that most people are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.
It is the happiness that comes from within that is lasting and fulfilling.
"Each person on this planet is inherently, intrinsically capable of attaining ""dizzying heights"" of happiness and fulfillment."
"The ingredients of happiness are so simple that they can be counted on one hand. Happiness comes from within, and rests most securely on simple goodness and clear conscience."
We are never so happy nor so unhappy as we imagine.
"You have to believe in happiness, or happiness never comes."
It is a man's proper business to seek happiness and avoid misery.
The best way to secure future happiness is to be as happy as is rightfully possible today.
"Why should we refuse the happiness this hour gives us, because some other hour might take it away?"
"At the end of our time on earth, if we have lived fully, we will not be able to say, ""I was always happy."" Hopefully, we will be able to say, ""I have experienced a lifetime of real moments, and many of them were happy moments."""
Cherish all your happy moments; they make a fine cushion for old age.
"Happiness is the meaning and the purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence."
The time to be happy is now. The place to be happy is here.
Happiness and love are just a choice away.
"Our happiness depends on the habit of mind we cultivate. So practice happy thinking every day. Cultivate the merry heart, develop the happiness habit, and life will become a continual feast."
"Humor is the healthy way of feeling ""distance"" between one's self and the problem, a way of standing off and looking at one's problems with perspective."
"Humor has great power to heal on an emotional level. You can't hold anger, you can't hold fear, you can't hold hurt while you're laughing."
Humor enables one to live in the midst of tragic events without becoming a tragic figure.
There is no defense against adverse fortune which is so effectual as an habitual sense of humor.
Humor is our way of defending ourselves from life's absurdities by thinking absurdly about them.
"Common sense and a sense of humor are the same thing, moving at different speeds. A sense of humor is just common sense, dancing."
"There is always something to chuckle about. Sometimes we see it. Sometimes . . . we don't. Still, the world is filled with humor. It is there when we are happy and it is there to cheer us up when we are not."
Joy is the most infallible sign of the Presence of God.
"Listen to the clues. The next time you feel real joy, stop and think. Pay attention. Because joy is the universe's way of knocking on your mind's door. Hello in there. Is anyone home? Can I leave a message? Yes? Good I The message is that you are happy, and that means that you are in touch with your purpose."
"Joy of life seems to me to arise from a sense of being where one belongs ... of being foursquare with the life we have chosen. All the discontented people I know are trying sedulously to be something they are not, to do something they cannot do."
"When we align our thoughts, emotions, and actions with the highest part of ourselves, we are filled with enthusiasm, purpose, and meaning. . . . We are joyously and intimately engaged with our world. This is the experience of authentic power."
We have a tendency to obscure the forest of simple joys with the trees of problems.
People need joy quite as much as clothing. Some of them need it far more.
"When large numbers of people share their joy in common, the happiness of each is greater because each adds fuel to the other's flame."
Joys divided are increased.
You increase your joy by increasing the pure joy of others.
"Joy increases as you give it, and diminishes as you try to keep it for yourself. In giving it, you will accumulate a deposit of joy greater than you ever believed possible."
"As you express joy, you draw it out of those you meet, creating joyful people and joyful events. The greater the joy you express, the more joy you experience."
"When we feel joyful, euphoric, happy, we are more open to life, more capable of seeing things clearly and handling daily tensions."
"If we could learn how to balance rest against effort, calmness against strain, quiet against turmoil, we would assure ourselves of joy in living and psychological health for life."
"Simplicity, clarity, singleness: these are the attributes that give our lives power and vividness and joy."
Joy is not in things; it is in us.
Joy is the feeling of grinning on the inside.
"Joy is the will which labors, which overcomes obstacles, which knows triumph."
"It is in the compelling zest of high adventure and of victory, and in creative action, that man finds his supreme joy."
"I believe humans were born to have joy and to have it more abundantly; that the birthright of everyone is loving, caring, sharing, and abundance."
Joy is your birthright.
Blessed are the joymakers.
"Although a lot can be learned from adversity, most of the same lessons can be learned through laughter and joy."
So when you're lonely or sad or bad or blue remember where laughter's hiding . . . it's hiding inside of YOU!
Against the assault of laughter nothing can stand.
"In every job, relationship, or life situation there is inevitably some turbulence. Learn to laugh at it. It is part of what you do and who you are"
"Laughter puts your brain, your central nervous system and your whole being into a state of free play."
Laughing deeply is living deeply.
It has always seemed to me that hearty laughter is a good way to jog internally without having to go outdoors.
A good belly laugh is like taking your liver for a horseback ride.
He laughs best whose laugh lasts.
Shared laughter is like throwing open the shutters in a gloomy room and letting in fresh air and sunshine.
Laughter is the sun that drives winter from the human race.
Shared laughter is love made audible.
A good laugh helps us recognize how ridiculous it is to get excited about matters that are often trivial. . . .
Laughter is the brush that sweeps away the cobwebs of the heart.
"When we can laugh through our tears, we are being given a powerful message. Things may be bad, but they cannot be all that bad."
"The child in you, like all children, loves to laugh, to be around people who can laugh at themselves and life. Children instinctively know that the more laughter we have in our lives, the better."
Laughter is a gift everyone should open.
In the true man there is a child concealed - who wants to play.
"Play keeps us vital and alive. It gives us an enthusiasm for life that is irreplaceable. Without it, life just doesn't taste good."
"It's good to play, and you must keep in practice."
The supreme accomplishment is to blur the line between work and play.
"A little work, a little play, To keep us going - and so, good-day!"
"Every time a man smiles, and much more when he laughs, it adds something to his fragment of life."
"What sunshine is to flowers, smiles are to humanity. They are but trifles, to be sure; but, scattered along life's pathway, the good they do is inconceivable."
"It's easy enough to be pleasant when everything goes like a song, but the man who is worthwhile, is the man who can smile, when everything goes dead wrong."
"If you have made another person on this earth smile, your life has been worthwhile."
Wrinkles should merely indicate where smiles have been.
"Of all the things you wear, your expression is the most important."
It is only through love that we can attain to communion with God. All living knowledge of God rest upon this foundation: that we experience Him in our lives as Will-to-love.
One word frees us of all the weight and pain of life: That word is love.
It makes no difference how deeply seated may be the trouble; how hopeless the outlook; how muddled the tangle; how great the mistake. A sufficient realization of love will dissolve it all. If only you could love enough you would be the happiest and most powerful being in the world.
Love is the master key which opens the gates of happiness.
"There is only one happiness in life, to love and be loved."
Let no one who loves be called unhappy. Even love unreturned has its rainbow.
"What a grand thing, to be loved! What a grander thing still, to lovel"
To love and be loved is to feel the sun from both sides.
Love . . . binds everything together in perfect harmony.
"For love ... is the blood of life, the power of reunion in the separated."
"It is this intangible thing, love in many forms, which enters into every therapeutic relationship. . . . And it is an element which binds and heals, which comforts and restores, which works what we have to call - for now - miracles."
"This is the miracle that happens every time to those who really love; the more they give, the more they possess."
The one thing we can never get enough of is love. And the one thing we never give enough of is love.
"Love sought is good, but given unsought is better."
Don't shut love out of your life by saying it's impossible to find time. The quickest way to receive love is to give; the fastest way to lose love is to hold it too tightly; and the best way to keep love is to give it wings.
The love we give away is the only one we keep.
"If you would be loved, love and be lovable."
"The issue is not so much being loved but being loving, which leads to the same wonderful feeling you experience when someone loves you."
Everybody forgets the basic thing: people are not going to love you unless you love them.
A loving person lives in a loving world. A hostile person lives in a hostile world: everyone you meet is your mirror.
"Nine times out of ten, when you extend your arms to someone, they will step in, because basically they need precisely what you need."
Love your enemies because they bring out the best in you.
Tolerance and celebration of individual differences is the fire that fuels lasting love.
"Do not waste time bothering whether you ""love"" your neighbor; act as if you did. As soon as we do this we find one of the great secrets. When you are behaving as if you loved someone, you will presently come to love him."
Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
"Love is a force that connects us to every strand of the universe, an unconditional state that characterizes human nature, a form of knowledge that is always there for us if only we can open ourselves to it."
"When we connect with ourselves in love, we can connect with others and the planet in love."
Choose to be a love-finder rather than a faultfinder.
"If you judge people, you have no time to love them."
"Someday, after we have mastered the winds, the waves, the tide and gravity, we shall harness for God the energies of love. Then, for the second time in the history of the world, man will have discovered fire."
Love keeps the cold out better than a cloak.
"In the coldest February, as in every other month in every other year, the best thing to hold on to in this world is each other."
"True love always brings joy to ourself and to the one we love. If our love does not bring joy to both of us, it is not true love."
"True love comes quietly, without banners or flashing lights. If you hear bells, get your ears checked."
"True love is night jasmine, a diamond in darkness, the heartbeat no cardiologist has ever heard. It is the most common of miracles, fashioned of fleecy clouds - a handful of stars tossed into the night sky."
The essence of love is kindness.
Love is what we were born with. Fear is what we learned here.
Love is letting go of fear.
"Love is much nicer to be in than an automobile accident, a tight girdle, a higher tax bracket, or a holding pattern over Philadelphia."
The Eskimos had fifty-two names for snow because it was important to them; there ought to be as many for love.
"Every single one of us can do things that no one else can do can love things that no one else can love . . . We are like violins. We can be used for doorstops, or we can make music."
"But some emotions don't make a lot of noise. It's hard to hear pride. Caring is real faint - like a heartbeat. And pure love why, some days it's so quiet, you don't even know it's there."
Love is not what we become but who we already are.
"Ultimately, love is self-approval."
"Love is, above all, the gift of oneself."
You must love yourself before you love another. By accepting yourself and fully being what you are . . . your simple presence can make others happy.
"It is not what we do, it is how much love we put in the doing."
"Forget the resolutions. Forget control and discipline . . . too much work. Instead try experimenting. Go in search of something to fall in love with. . . something about yourself, your career, your spouse."
Find something you love to do and you'll never have to work a day in your life.
"You will find, as you look back upon your life, that the moments when you really lived are the moments when you have done things in the spirit of love."
We are most alive when we're in love.

I want it to be gain, and not loss; good, and not evil; success, and not failure; in order that I shall not regret the price I have paid for it."

Only that day dawns to which we are awake.
"The day returns and brings us the petty round of irritating concerns and duties. Help us to play the man, help us to perform them with laughter and kind faces; let cheerfulness abound with industry. Give us to go blithely on our business all this day, bring us to our resting beds weary and content and undishonored, and grant us in the end the gift of sleep."
"A day dawns, quite like other days; in it, a single hour comes, quite like other hours; but in that day and in that hour the chance of a lifetime faces us."

"There will be something, anguish or elation, that is peculiar to this day alone. I rise from sleep and say: Hail to the morning! Come down to me, my beautiful unknown."

"If you watch how nature deals with adversity, continually renewing itself, you can't help but learn."
"Rivers and rocks and trees have always been talking to us, but we've forgotten how to listen."
"Speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee."
Adopt the pace of nature: her secret is patience.
"Climb the mountains and get their good tidings: Nature's peace will flow into you as sunshine into flowers, the winds will blow their freshness into you, and the storms, their energy and cares will drop off like autumn leaves."
Nature tops the list of potent tranquilizers and stress reducers. The mere sound of moving water has been shown to lower blood pressure.
The sun - my almighty physician.
"Nature uses only the longest threads to weave her patterns, so each small piece of her fabric reveals the organization of the entire tapestry."
"The finest workers in stone are not copper or steel tools, but the gentle touches of air and water working at their leisure with a liberal allowance of time."
To the dull mind all nature is leaden. To the illumined mind the whole world burns and sparkles with light.
"The beauty of the world and the orderly arrangement of everything celestial makes us confess that there is an excellent and eternal nature, which ought to be worshiped and admired by all mankind."
In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous.
"The sun gives us light, but the moon provides inspiration. If you look at the sun without shielding your eyes, you'll go blind. If you look at the moon without covering your eyes, you'll become a poet."
"The world is full of poetry. The air is living with its spirit; and the waves dance to the music of its melodies, and sparkle in its brightness."
The sky is the daily bread of the eyes.
My heart leaps up when I behold a rainbow in the sky.
The bluebird carries the sky on his back.
The clearest way into the Universe is through a forest wilderness.
"We lose our souls if we lose the experience of the forest, the butterflies, the song of the birds, if we can't see the stars at night."
Forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair.
"As long as the Earth can make a spring every year, I can. As long as the Earth can flower and produce nurturing fruit, I can, because I'm the Earth. I won't give up until the Earth gives up."
The creation of a thousand forests is in one acorn.
"I never knew how soothing trees are - many trees and patches of open sunlight, and tree presences; it is almost like having another being."
Nature is saturated with deity.
"Our Lord has written the promise of resurrection, not in books alone but in every leaf of springtime."
The nicest thing about the promise of spring is that sooner or later she'll have to keep it.
"Spring is nature's way of saying, ""Let's party!"""
"It was one of those perfect summer days - the sun was shining, a breeze was blowing, the birds were singing, and the lawnmower was broken."
"Nobody sees a flower - really - it is so small it takes time -  we haven't time - and to see takes time, like to have a friend takes time."
"Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these."
The AmenT of Nature is always a flower.
"Next time a sunrise steals your breath or a meadow of flowers leave you speechless, remain that way. Say nothing, and listen as heaven whispers, ""Do you like it? I did it just for you."""
Every flower is a soul blossoming in Nature.
"Flowers always make people better, happier, and more helpful; they are sunshine, food, and medicine to the soul."
Earth laughs in flowers.
God Almighty first planted a garden. And indeed it is the purest of human pleasures.
"Pleasure for an hour, a bottle of wine; pleasure for a year, marriage; pleasure for a lifetime, a garden."
"The kiss of sun for pardon, The song of the birds for mirth One is nearer God's Heart in a garden Than anywhere else on earth."
All gardeners live in beautiful places because they make them so.
All gardening is landscape painting.
What is a weed? A plant whose virtues have not yet been discovered.
"For many years I was self-appointed inspector of snowstorms and rainstorms, and did my duty faithfully, though I never received one cent for it."
"The next time it begins to rain ... lie down on your belly, nestle your chin into the grass, and get a frog's-eye view of how raindrops fall . . . The sight of hundreds of blades of grass bowing down and popping back up like piano keys strikes me as one of the merriest sights in the world."
"Sunshine is delicious, rain is refreshing, wind braces us up, snow is exhilarating; there is really no such thing as bad weather, only different kinds of good weather."
Don't knock the weather; nine-tenths of the people couldn't start a conversation if it didn't change once in a while.
After rain comes fair weather.
Weather means more when you have a garden. There's nothing like listening to a shower and thinking how it is soaking in around your green beans.
This is the day the Lord had made. We will rejoice and be glad in it.
"I have always been delighted at the prospect of a new day, a fresh try, one more start, with perhaps a bit of magic waiting somewhere behind the morning."
"Whether one is twenty, forty, or sixty; whether one has succeeded, failed or just muddled along; whether yesterday was full of sun or storm, or one of those dull days with no weather at all, life begins each morning I"
"Today a new sun rises for me; everything lives, everything is animated, everything seems to speak to me of my passion, everything invites me to cherish it."
Every new day begins with possibilities. It's up to us to fill it with the things that move us toward progress and peace.
I love the challenge of starting at zero every day and seeing how much I can accomplish.
"Thank God ever morning when you get up that you have something to do which must be done, whether you like it or not."
"Today is a new day. You will get out of it just what you put into it. . . If you have made mistakes, even serious mistakes, there is always another chance for you. . . . for this thing that we call ""failure"" is not the falling down, but the staying down."
Finish each day and be done with it. You have done what you could; some blunders and absurdities have crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day; you shall begin it serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense.
"Live your life each day as you would climb a mountain. An occasional glance toward the summit keeps the goal in mind, but many beautiful scenes are to be observed from each new vantage point. Climb slowly, steadily, enjoying each passing moment; and the view from the summit will serve as a fitting climax for the journey."
Nothing is worth more than this day.
Write it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year.
"Normal day, let me be aware of the treasure you are. Let me learn from you, love you, bless you before you depart. Let me not pass you by in quest of some rare and perfect tomorrow."
"Yesterday is not ours to recover, but tomorrow is ours to win or lose."
"When all else is lost, the future still remains."
"When I look at the future, it's so bright, it burns my eyes."
"Earth's crammed with Heaven, And every common bush afire with God."
"To him who in the love of Nature holds Communion with her visible forms, she speaks A various language."
"I love not man the less, but nature more."
"For Art may err, but Nature cannot miss."
"The woods were made for the hunter of dreams, The brooks for the fishes of song."
Nature is a volume of which God is the author.
"Nature, like a kind and smiling mother, lends herself to our dreams and cherishes our fancies."
"Accuse not Nature, she hath done her part; Do thou but thine!"
"Grass is the forgiveness of nature - her constant benediction. ... Forests decay, harvests perish, flowers vanish, but grass is immortal."
Everything in nature acts in conformity with law.
Nature abhors a vacuum.
"To hold, as 't were, the mirror up to nature."
"I chatter, chatter, as I flow To join the brimming river, For men may come and men may go, But I go on forever."
"When I would recreate myself, I seek the darkest wood, the thickest and most interminable, and to the citizen, most dismal swamp. I enter a swamp as a sacred place -  a sanctum sanctorum. There is the strength, the marrow of Nature."
One touch of nature makes the whole world kin.
Nature has always had more force than education.
"O pilot! 'tis a fearful night, There's danger on the deep."
The winds and waves are always on the side of the ablest navigators.
"Oh, I am a cook and a captain bold And the mate of the Nancy brig, And a bo'sun tight and a midshipmate And the crew of the captain's gig."
"Thus, I steer my bark, and sail On even keel, with gentle gale."
"Hearts of oak are our ships, Hearts of oak are our men."
"Now landsmen all, whoever you may be, If you want to rise to the top of the tree. If your soul isn't fettered to an office stool, Be careful to be guided by this golden rule -  Stick close to your desks and never go to to sea, And you may all be Rulers of the Queen's Navee."
Necessity has no law.
"Necessity, the mother of invention."
Necessity is often the spur to genius.
Necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom. It is the argument of tyrants; it is the creed of slaves.
Necessity makes even the timid brave.
"Not for myself I make this prayer, But for this race of mine That stretches forth from shadowed places Dark hands for bread and wine."
The image of God cut in ebony.
"O black and unknown bards of long ago, How came your lips to touch the sacred fire? How, in your darkness, did you come to know The power and beauty of the minstrel's lyre?"
In the Negro countenance you will often meet with strong traits of benignity. I have felt yearnings of tenderness towards some of these faces.
The best way to uncolor the Negro is to give the white man a white heart.
"The Negro is an exotic of the most gorgeous and superb countries of the world, and he has deep in his heart a passion for all that is splendid, rich and fanciful."
We can live without our friends but not without our neighbors.
When your neighbor's house is afire your own property is at stake.
Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
"The crop always seems better in our neighbor's field, and our neighbor's cow gives more milk."
In the field of world policy I would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbor.
The cold neutrality of an impartial judge.
"Neutrality, as a lasting principle, is an evidence of weakness."
"A wise neuter joins with neither, but uses both, as his honest interest leads him."
The heart is never neutral.

I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude.

"I like to visit New York, but I wouldn't live there if you gave it to me."
"If there ever was an aviary overstocked with jays it is that Yaptown-on-the-Hudson, called New York."
"Vulgar of manner, overfed. Overdressed and underbred; Heartless, Godless, hell's delight, Rude by day and lewd by night; Bedwarfed the man, o'ergrown the brute, Ruled by boss and prostitute; Purple-robed and pauper-clad, Raving, rotting, money-mad; A squirming herd in Mammon's mesh, A wilderness of human flesh; Crazed with avarice, lust and rum, New York, thy name's Delirium."
Spick and span new.
"What is valuable is not new, and what is new is not valuable."
"If a man bites a dog, that is news."
By evil report and good report.
"As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country."
There's villainous news abroad.
When we hear news we should always wait for the sacrament of confirmation.
Freedom of the press in Britain is freedom to print such of the proprietor's prejudices as the advertisers don't object to.
"Newspapers have developed what might be called a vested interest in catastrophe. If they can spot a fight, they play up that fight. If they can uncover a tragedy, they will headline that tragedy."
"Everything you read in the newspapers is absolutely true, except for that rare story of which you happen to have first-hand knowledge."
"I do not take a single newspaper, nor read one a month and I feel myself infinitely the happier for it."
"Burke said there were three Estates in Parliament; but in the reporters' gallery yonder, there sat a fourth Estate more important than them all."
Comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.
"Remember, son, many a good story has been ruined by over-verification."
"Don't be afraid to make a mistake, your readers might like it."
One newspaper a day ought to be enough for anyone who still prefers to retain a little mental balance.
Journalism is literature in a hurry.
"The sports page records people's accomplishments, the front page usually records nothing but man's failures."
"If some great catastrophe is not announced every morning, we feel a certain void. 'Nothing in the paper today,' we sigh."
"Carelessness is not fatal to journalism, nor are cliches, for the eye rests lightly on them. But what is intended to be read once can seldom be read more than once; a journalist has to accept the fact that his work, by its very todayness, is excluded from any share in tomorrow."
"He had been kicked in the head by a mule when young, and believed everything he read in the Sunday papers."
"An editor - a person employed on a newspaper, whose business it is to separate the wheat from the chaff, and to see that the chaff is printed."
The day you write to please everyone you no longer are in journalism. You are in show business.
News is the first rough draft of history.
It is a newspaper's duty to print the news and raise hell.
"What you see is news, what you know is background, what you feel is opinion."
Freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one.
A good newspaper is a nation talking to itself.
"The first essence of journalism is to know what you want to know; the second, is to find out who will tell you."
Today's reporter is forced to become an educator more concerned with explaining the news than with being first on the scene.
"A writer who takes up journalism abandons the slow tempo of literature for a faster one and the change will do him harm. By degrees the flippancy of journalism will become a habit and the pleasure of being paid on the nail and more especially of being praised on the nail, grow indispensable."
Newspapers are the world's mirrors.
"Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter."
Every editor of newspapers pays tribute to the devil.
Four hostile newspapers are more to be feared than a thousand bayonets.
"Let me make the newspapers, and I care not what is preached in the pulpit or what is enacted in Congress."
AH I know is what I see in the papers.
"The Night has a thousand eyes, The Day but one; Yet the light of the bright world dies With the dying sun."
For the night Shows stars and women in a better light.
Night's black Mantle covers all alike.
"Watchman, what of the night?"
"Night, when deep sleep falleth on men."
The night cometh when no man can work.
"And the night shall be filled with music And the cares, that infest the day, Shall fold their tents, like the Arabs, And as silently steal away."
In a real dark night of the soul it is always three o'clock in the morning.
The nearer the dawn the darker the night.
"The night is dark, and I am far from home."
"To all, to each, a fair good night, And pleasing dreams; and slumbers light."
Making night hideous.
It is the hour when from the boughs The nightingale's high note is heard; It is the hour when lovers' vows Seem sweet in every whisper'd word.
"Hark! that's the nightingale, Telling the self-same tale Her song told when this ancient earth was young: So echoes answered when her song was sung In the first wooded vale."
"The angel of spring, the mellow-throated nightingale."
"I am not the smartest or most talented person in the world, but I succeeded because I keep going, and going, and going."
"I know the price of success: dedication, hard work and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen."
Victory belongs to the most persevering.
Success generally depends upon knowing how long it takes to succeed.
Success seems to be largely a matter of hanging on after others have let go.
"If you wish success in life, make perseverance your bosom friend."
"They who are the most persistent, and work in the true spirit, will invariably be the most successful."
"If at first you don't succeed, try, try, try again."
"If at first you don't succeed, you're running about average."
The secret of success is constancy of purpose.
"The only way to the top is by persistent, intelligent, hard work."
"The heights by great men reached and kept Were not attained by sudden flight, But they, while their companions slept Were toiling upward in the night."
"I realized early on that success was tied to not giving up. Most people in this business gave up and went on to other things. If you simply didn't give up, you would outlast the people who came in on the bus with you."
"Call the roll in your memory of conspicuously successful [business] giants and, if you know anything about their careers, you will be struck by the fact that almost every one of them encountered inordinate difficulties sufficient to crush all but the gamest of spirits. Edison went hungry many times before he became famous."
"Perseverance is a great element of success. If you only knock long enough and loud enough at the gate, you are sure to wake up somebody."
"Four steps to achievement: plan purposefully, prepare prayerfully, proceed positively, pursue persistently."
"Flaming enthusiasm, backed up by horse sense and persistence, is the quality that most frequently makes for success."
Diamonds are only lumps of coal that stuck to their jobs.
"Persistence is the master virtue. Without it, there is no other."
"I'm hardnosed about luck. I think it sucks. Yeah, if you spend seven years looking for a job as a copywriter, and then one day somebody gives you a job, you can say, ""Gee, I was lucky I happened to go up there today."" But dammit, I was going to go up there sooner or later in the next seventy years. ... If you're persistent in trying and doing and working, you almost make your own fortune."
It's the plugging away that will win you the day So don't be a piker old pard! Just draw on your grit; it's so easy to quit- It's the keeping your chin up that's hard.
No one succeeds without effort. ... Those who succeed owe their success to their perseverance.
Big shots are only little shots who keep shooting.
"Be of good cheer. Do not think of today's failures, but of the success that may come tomorrow. You have set yourselves a difficult task, but you will succeed if you persevere; and you will find a joy in overcoming obstacles. Remember, no effort that we make to attain something beautiful is ever lost."
The way to succeed is never quit. That's it. But really be humble about it.... You start out lowly and humble and you carefully try to learn an accretion of little things that help you get there.
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going.
Continuous efforts-not strength or intelligence-is the key to unlocking our potential.
Plodding wins the race.
The difficulties and struggles of today are but the price we must pay for the accomplishments and victories of tomorrow.
Let me tell you the secret that has led me to my goal: my strength lies solely in my tenacity.
A winner never quits and a quitter never wins.
"Men who have attained things worth having in this world have worked while others idled, have persevered when others gave up in despair, have practiced early in life the valuable habits of self-denial, industry, and singleness of purpose. As a result, they enjoy in later life the success so often erroneously attributed to good luck."
"In the realm of ideas, everything depends on enthusiasm; in the real world, all rests on perseverance."
There's such a thin line between winning and losing.
It is easier to begin well than to finish well.
The great majority of men are bundles of beginnings.
I hope I shall have ambition until the day I die.
"When you put your hand to the plow, you can't put it down until you get to the end of the row."
"Out of the strain of the Doing, Into the peace of the Done."
"Great is the art of beginning, but greater is the art of ending."
"There are two parts to the creative endeavor: making something, then disseminating it."
"We rate ability in men by what they finish, not by what they begin."
A chicken doesn't stop scratching just because worms are scarce.
"Everyone has his superstitions. One of mine has always been when I started to go anywhere, or to do anything, never to turn back or to stop until the thing intended was accomplished."
"I just kept on doing what everyone starts out doing. The real question is, why did other people stop?"
Men perish because they cannot join the beginning with the end.
Business is full of brilliant men who started out with a spurt and lacked the stamina to finish. Their places were taken by patient and unshowy plodders who never knew when to quit.

A little more persistence, a little more effort, and what seemed hopeless failure may turn to glorious success."
"When you get to the end of your rope, tie a knot and hang on."

Triumph often is nearest when defeat seems inescapable.
"Don't bother about genius. Don't worry about being clever. Trust to hard work, perseverance and determination. And the best motto for a long march is, ""Don't grumble. Plug on!"""
"Some men give up their designs when they have almost reached the goal; while others, on the contrary, obtain a victory by exerting, at the last moment, more vigorous efforts than before."
Never stop. One always stops as soon as something is about to happen.
Many of life's failures are men who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.

"Only yield when you must, never ""give up the ship,"" but fight on to the last ""with a stiff upper lip!"""
Defeat never comes to any man until he admits it.
There is something in me-I just can't stand to admit defeat.
There was no such thing as defeat if you didn't accept it.

I have accepted fear as a part of life-specifically the fear of change. ... I have gone ahead despite the pounding in the heart that says: turn back. ...

Jesus taught that perseverance is the essential element of prayer. Men must be in earnest when they kneel at God's footstool. Too often we get faint-hearted and quit praying at the point when we ought to begin. We let go at the very point where we should hold on strongest. Our prayers are weak because they are not impassioned by an unfailing and resistless will.

The eyes are the window of the soul.
To survive the day is triumph enough for the walking wounded among the great many of us.

The organized person ... makes the most of his time and goes to his bed for the night perfectly relaxed for rest and renewal.
"Have regular hours for work and play; make each day both useful and pleasant, and prove that you understand the worth of time by employing it well. Then youth will be delightful, old age will bring few regrets, and life will become a beautiful success."
"He who every morning plans the transactions of the day and follows out that plan carries a thread that will guide him through the labyrinth of the most busy life. ... If the disposal of time is surrendered merely to the chance of incident, chaos will soon reign."
"Have a time and place for everything, and do everything in its time and place, and you will not only accomplish more, but have far more leisure than those who are always hurrying."
"It is not how many years we live, but rather what we do with them."
"During a very busy life I have often been asked, ""How did you manage to it all?"" The answer is very simple: it is because I did everything promptly."
"Time cannot be expanded, accumulated, mortgaged, hastened, or retarded."
Seize time by the forelock.
Time is a tyranny to be abolished.
"The time which we have at our disposal every day is elastic; the passions that we feel expand it, those that we inspire contract it; and habit fills up the rest."
The ability to concentrate and to use time well is everything.
"Time is an equal opportunity employer. Each human being has exactly the same number of hours and minutes every day. Rich people can't buy more hours. Scientists can't invent new minutes. And you can't save time to spend it on another day. Even so, time is amazingly fair and forgiving. No matter how much time you've wasted in the past, you still have an entire tomorrow. Success depends upon using it wisely-by planning and setting priorities."
"An Italian philosopher said that ""time was his estate""; an estate indeed which will produce nothing without cultivation, but will always abundantly repay the labors of industry, and generally satisfy the most extensive desires, if no part of it be suffered to lie in waste by negligence, to be overrun with noxious plants, or laid out for show rather than for use."
"Timely service, like timely gifts, is doubled in value."
Time is the one thing that can never be retrieved.
"We must use time as a tool, not as a crutch."
"Make use of time, let not advantage slip."
"O, for an engine to keep back all clocks!"
"You may delay, but time will not."
He who would make serious use of his life must always act as though he had a long time to live and schedule his time as though he were about to die.
The highest value in life is found in the stewardship of time.
A stale mind is the devil's breadbox.
"I wish I could stand on a busy corner, hat in hand, and beg people to throw me all their wasted hours."
"Every day I live I am more convinced that the waste of life lies in the love we have not given, the powers we have not used, the selfish prudence that will risk nothing and which, shirking pain, misses happiness as well."
Wasted time means wasted lives.
"Regret for time wasted can become a power for good in the time that remains, if we will only stop the waste and the idle, useless regretting."
Economy is the thief of time.
"I wasted time, and now doth time waste me."
All that time is lost which might be better employed.
"Lost, yesterday, somewhere between sunrise and sunset, two golden hours, each set with sixty diamond minutes. No reward is offered, for they are gone forever."
"Thrift of time will repay you in afterlife, with a usury of profit beyond your most sanguine dreams; waste of it will make you dwindle, alike in intellectual and moral stature, beyond your darkest reckoning."
The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.
"Time is lost when we have not lived a full human life, time unenriched by experience, creative endeavor, enjoyment, and suffering."
"Still on it creeps, Each little moment at another's heels, Till hours, days, years, and ages are made up Of such small parts as these, and men look back Worn and bewilder'd, wondering how it is."
"Does't thou love life? Then do not squander time, for that is the stuff life is made of."
Time wasted is a theft from God.
Lost time is like a run in a stocking. It always gets worse.
As if you could kill time without injuring eternity.
Killing time is the chief end of our society.
"You can kill time or kill yourself, it comes to the same thing in the end."
No person will have occasion to complain of the want of time who never loses any.
"Time is that which man is always trying to kill, but which ends in killing him."
"Do not wait for leaders; do it alone, person to person."
"Men talk of killing time, while time quietly kills them."
Modern man thinks he loses something-time-when he does not do things quickly. Yet he does not know what to do with the time he gains- except kill it.
"If you want to kill time, try working it to death."
A man who dares to waste one hour of life has not discovered the value of life.
"If time be of all things most precious, wasting time must be the greatest prodigality, since lost time is never found again."
Don't agonize. Organize.
Curse ruthless time! Curse our mortality. How cruelly short is the allotted span for all we must cram into it!
Death and taxes and childbirth! There's never any convenient time for any of them!
There is a time for work. And a time for love. That leaves no other time.
"You will never ""find"" time for anything. If you want time you must make it."
We have as much time as we need.
Ah! the clock is always slow; it is later than you think.
The forty-four-hour week has no charm for me. I'm looking for a forty-hour day.
Those who make the worst use of their time most complain of its brevity.
"I still find each day too short for all the thoughts I want to think, all the walks I want to take, all the books I want to read, and all the friends I want to see."
What we love to do we find time to do.
Time stays long enough for anyone who will use it.
There is time for everything.
It is nonsense to say there is not enough time to be fully informed. ... Time given to thought is the greatest timesaver of all.
We all find time to do what we really want to do.
"Time is a fixed income and, as with any income, the real problem facing most of us is how to live successfully within our daily allotment."
"We shall never have more time. We have, and have always had, all the time there is. No object is served in waiting until next week or even until to-morrow. Keep going. ... Concentrate on something useful."
There is time enough for everything in the course of the day if you do but one thing at once; but there is not time enough in the year if you will do two things at a time.
"Much may be done in those little shreds and patches of time which every day produces, and which most men throw away."
Learn to use ten minutes intelligently. It will pay you huge dividends.
It is better to do the most trifling thing in the world than to regard half an hour as trifle.
"I recommend you to take care of the minutes, for the hours will take care of themselves."
"The real secret of how to use time is to pack it as you would a portmanteau, filling up the small spaces with small things."
"One must learn a different... sense of time, one that depends more on small amounts than big ones."
"An earnest purpose finds time, or makes it. It seizes on spare moments, and turns fragments to golden account."
Guard well your spare moments. They are like uncut diamonds. Discard them and their value will never be known. Improve them and they will become the brightest gems in a useful life.
"The butterfly counts not months but moments, and has time enough."
"That man is happiest who lives from day to day and asks no more, garnering the simple goodness of life."
It is only possible to live happily-ever-after on a day-to-day basis.
"Happiness is produced not so much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen, as by little advantages that occur every day."
All the great blessings of my life are present in my thoughts today.
The best way to secure future happiness is to be as happy as is rightfully possible today.
"A fool bolts pleasure, then complains of indigestion."
"Happiness is to be found along the way, not at the end of the road, for then the journey is over and it is too late. Today, this hour, this minute is the day, the hour, the minute for each of us to sense the fact that life is good, with all of its trials and troubles, and perhaps more interesting because of them."
Each day provides its own gifts.
Let us savour the swift delights of the most beautiful of our days!
"Death accompanies us at every step and enables us to use those moments when life smiles at us to feel more deeply the sweetness of life. The more certain the end, the more tempting the minute."
"Happiness is not a state to arrive at, but a manner of traveling."
"My advice to you is not to inquire why or whither, but just to enjoy your ice cream while it's on your plate."
"Those who face that which is actually before them, unburdened by the past, undistracted by the future, these are they who live, who make the best use of their lives; these are those who have found the secret of contentment."
"And that was victory. The freedom to sprawl loosely upon a city street, heat his coffee and eat a can of beans ... with no enemy bullets forcing him to toss the can aside while diving behind another wall for momentary survival."
"Taking time to live is taking time to appreciate simple silence as better than any kind of talk, or watching a flower, or watching a guy wash the windows on a skyscraper and wondering what he is thinking."
"If you observe a really happy man, you will find ... that he is happy in tiie course of living life twenty-four crowded hours each day."
"To fill the hour, that is happiness; to fill the hour, and leave no crevice for a repentance or an approval."
"Live your life each day as you would climb a mountain. An occasional glance toward the summit keeps the goal in mind, but many beautiful scenes are to be observed from each new vantage point. Climb slowly, steadily, enjoying each passing moment; and the view from the summit will serve as a fitting climax for the journey."
One day of pleasure is worth two of sorrow.
Present joys are more to flesh and blood Than the dull prospect of a distant good.
"In order to be utterly happy the only thing necessary is to refrain from comparing this moment with other moments in the past, which I often did not fully enjoy because I was comparing them with other moments of the future."
Live in day-tight compartments.
"If you are not happy here and now, you never will be."
People who postpone happiness are like children who try chasing rainbows in an effort to find the pot of gold at the rainbow's end. ... Your life will never be fulfilled until you are happy here and now.
He's one of those Christmas Eve guys. There are people like that. . . every day in their lives is Christmas Eve.
Learn to drink the cup of life as it comes.
Every day give yourself a good mental shampoo.
"There is no other solution to man's progress but the day's honest work, the day's honest decisions, the day's generous utterances and the day's good deed."
"Leisure for reverie, gay or somber, does much to enrich life."
"A man should hear a little music, read a little poetry, and see a fine picture every day of his life, in order that worldly cares may not obliterate the sense of the beautiful which God has implanted in the human soul."
You have to set new goals every day.
"I have resolved that from this day on, I will do all the business I can honestly, have all the fun I can reasonably, do all the good I can willingly, and save my digestion by thinking pleasantly."
Make the most of today. Translate your good intentions into actual deeds.
"Today is the day in which to express your noblest qualities of mind and heart, to do at least one worthy thing which you have long postponed."
"Do what you can, with what you have, where you are."
Our grand business undoubtedly is not to see what lies dimly at a distance but to do what lies clearly at hand.
My formula for living is quite simple. I get up in the morning and I go to bed at night. In between I occupy myself as best I can.
What you are afraid to do is a clear indicator of the next thing you need to do.
"If we cannot meet our everyday surroundings with equanimity and pleasure and grow each day in some useful direction, then ... life is on the road toward misfortune, misery and destruction."
"A day's work is a day's work, neither more nor less, and the man who does it needs a day's sustenance, a night's repose and due leisure, whether he be painter or ploughman."
Add each day something to fortify you against poverty and death.
It isn't hard to be good from time to time in sports. What's tough is being good every day.
Make it a point to do something every day that you don't want to do. This is the golden rule for acquiring the habit of doing your duty without pain.
Realize life as an end in itself. Functioning is all there is.
He has not learned the first lesson of life who does not every day surmount a fear.
A homer a day will boost my pay.
"Act well at the moment, and you have performed a good action to all eternity."
"If I had my life to live over, I would start barefoot earlier in the spring and stay that way later in the fall. I would go to more dances. I would ride more merry-go-rounds. I would pick more daisies."
Nothing determines who we will become so much as those things we choose to ignore.
"Love, and do what you like."
Take the time to come home to yourself everyday.
"The power of a man's virtue should not be measured by his special efforts, but by his ordinary doing."

It is no easy thing for a principle to become a man's own unless each day he maintains it and works it out in his life.
Follow your bliss. -Joseph Campbell Resolve to perform what you ought. Perform without fail what you resolve.
"Resolve to edge in a little reading every day, if it is but a single sentence. If you gain fifteen minutes a day, it will make itself felt at the end of the year."
"I work every day-or at least I force myself into my office or room. I may get nothing done, but you don't earn bonuses without putting in time. Nothing may come for three months, but you don't get the fourth without it."
"Take short views, hope for the best, and trust in God."
Each day can be one of triumph if you keep up your interests.
"When action grows unprofitable, gather information; when information grows unprofitable, sleep."
"I long to accomplish a great and noble task, but it is my chief duty to accomplish small tasks as if they were great and noble."
"To do the useful thing, to say the courageous thing, to contemplate the beautiful thing: that is enough for one man's life."
Showing up is 80 percent of life.
"Do you know that disease and death must needs overtake us, no matter what we are doing? ... What do you wish to be doing when it overtakes you? If you have anything better to be doing when you are so overtaken, get to work on that."
"Have patience with all things, but chiefly have patience with yourself. Do not lose courage in considering your own imperfections, but instantly set about remedying them-every day begin the task anew."
"Without duty, life is soft and boneless."
"A man may fulfill the object of his existence by asking a question he cannot answer, and attempting a task he cannot achieve."
And each man stands with his face in the light of his own drawn sword. Ready to do what a hero can.
Every day give yourself a good mental shampoo.
"To look up and not down, To look forward and not back, To look out and not in, and To lend a hand."
"Do all the good you can, By all the means you can, In all the ways you can, In all the places you can, At all the times you can."

To accomplish our destiny ... we must cover before nightfall the distance assigned to each of us.
Each day should be passed as though it were our last.
Learn as if you were going to live forever. Live as if you were going to die tomorrow.
One should count each day a separate life.
"If, every day, I dare to remember that I am here on loan, that this house, this hillside, these minutes are all leased to me, not given, I will never despair."
"To live each day as though one's last, never flustered, never apathetic, never attitudinizing-here is perfection of character."
Look at everything as though you were seeing it for the first time or the last time. Then your time on earth will be filled with glory.
"The years seem to rush by now, and I think of death as a fast approaching end of a journey-double and treble reason for loving as well as working while it is day."
Study as if you were going to live forever; live as if you were going to die tomorrow.
Every day is a little life ... live every day as if it would be the last. Those that dare lose a day are dangerously prodigal; those that dare misspend it are desperate.
"You have to count on living every single day in a way you believe will make you feel good about your life- so that if it were over tomorrow, you'd be content with yourself."
No one can confidently say that he will still be living tomorrow.
"Happy the man, and happy he alone He who can call today his own He who, secure within, can say ""Tomorrow, do thy worst For I have lived today."""
Do your best every day and your life will gradually expand into satisfying fullness.
"There are only three colors, ten digits, and seven notes; it's what we do with them that's important."
Any man's life will be filled with constant and unexpected encouragement if he makes up his mind to do his level best each day.
Do each daily task the best we can; act as though the eye of opportunity were always upon us.
"What a man accomplishes in a day depends upon the way in which he approaches his tasks. When we accept tough jobs as a challenge to our ability and wade into them with joy and enthusiasm, miracles can happen."
"Look at a day when you are supremely satisfied at the end. It's not a day when you lounge around doing nothing; it's when you've had everything to do, and you've done it."
So get a few laughs and do the best you can.
"I come to the office each morning and stay for long hours doing what has to be done to the best of my ability. And when you've done the best you can, you can't do any better. So when I go to sleep I turn everything over to the Lord and forget it."
That man is blest who does his best and leaves the rest.
"When you rise in the morning, form a resolution to make the day a happy one for a fellow creature."
"He who allows his day to pass by without practicing generosity and enjoying life's pleasures is like a blacksmith's bellows; he breathes, but does not live."

Sweets are good for the nerves.
Fat gives things flavor.
"Friends, I beg you do not shirk your daily task of indolence."
"If someone said, ""Write a sentence about your life,"" I'd write, ""I want to go outside and play."""
We should consider every day lost on which we have not danced at least once.
Life is about enjoying yourself and having a good time.
Put a little fun into your life. Try dancing.
He who does not get fun and enjoyment out of every day ... needs to reorganize his life.
"Unless each day can be looked back upon by an individual as one in which he has had some fun, some joy, some real satisfaction, that day is a loss."
Take time every day to do something silly.
It's fun to get together and have something good to eat at least once a day. That's what human life is all about-enjoying things.
"Come, let us give a little time to folly ... and even in a melancholy day let us find time for an hour of pleasure."
"No matter what looms ahead, if you can eat today, enjoy the sunlight today, mix good cheer with friends today, enjoy it and bless God for it."
"Be Satisfied with a Good Day's Work There are hundreds of tasks we feel we must accomplish in the day, but if we do not take them one at a time ... we are bound to break our own physical or mental structure."
A man can do only what he can do. But if he does that each day he can sleep at night and do it again the next day.
"If I had my life to live over, I would start barefoot earlier in the spring and stay that way later in the fall. I would go to more dances. I would ride more merry-go-rounds. I would pick more daisies."
I finally figured out the only reason to be alive is to enjoy it.
"We cannot do everything at once, but we can do something at once."
Always do one thing less than you think you can do.
"I come to the office each morning and stay for long hours doing what has to be done to the best of my ability. And when you've done the best you can, you can't do any better. So when I go to sleep I turn everything over to the Lord and forget it."
"A day's work is a day's work, neither more nor less, and the man who does it needs a day's sustenance, a night's repose and due leisure, whether he be painter or ploughman."
Sufficient to each day are the duties to be done and the trials to be endured.
"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith."
"I look back on my life like a good day's work; it is done, and I am satisfied with it."
The moment we pass out of our habits we lose all sense of permanency and routine.
"Manners are a sensitive awareness of the feelings of others. If you have that awareness, you have good manners, no matter what fork you use."
And hearts have been broken from harsh words spoken That sorrow can ne'er set right.
That which is horrifying to you don't do to anybody else.
It is too bad if you have to do everything upon reflection and can't do anything from early habit.
"Most of life is routine-dull and grubby, but routine is the mountain that keeps a man going. If you wait for inspiration you'll be standing on the corner after the parade is a mile down the street."
"Good habits, which bring our lower passions and appetites under automatic control, leave our natures free to explore the larger experiences of life."
"Without the aid of prejudice and custom, I should not be able to find my way across the room."
Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going.
"Habits are safer than rules; you don't have to watch them. And you don't have to keep them, either; they keep you."
"Habit is not mere subjugation, it is a tender tie; when one remembers habit it seems to have been happiness."
"To learn new habits is everything, for it is to reach the substance of life. Life is but a tissue of habits."
"Choose always the way that seems the best, however rough it may be; custom will soon render it easy and agreeable."
Quality is not an act. It is a habit.
It is not in novelty but in habit that we find the greatest pleasure.
Habit is stronger than reason.
Character is simply habit long enough continued.
Nothing is more powerful than habit.
"If you do the same thing every day at the same time for the same length of time, you'll save yourself from many a sink. Routine is a condition of survival."
"Have a time and place for everything, and do everything in its time and place, and you will not only accomplish more, but have far more leisure than those who are always hurrying."
"Anyone can carry his burden, however hard, until nightfall. Anyone can do his work, however hard, for one day. Anyone can live sweetly, patiently, lovingly, purely, till the sun goes down. And this is all life really means."
"Come what may, time and the hour runs through the roughest day."
"At any rate, you can bear it for a quarter of an hour!"
The longest day is soon ended.
The secret of my success is that I always managed to live to fly another day.
"The time which we have at our disposal every day is elastic; the passions that we feel expand it, those that we inspire contract it; and habit fills up what remains."
A day is a miniature eternity.
"One day, with life and heart, is more than time enough to find a world."
A day is a span of time no one is wealthy enough to waste.
"When a man sits with a pretty girl for an hour, it seems like a minute. But let him sit on a hot stove for a minute, and it's longer than any hour. That's relativity."
"Too slow for those who wait, Too swift for those who fear, Too long for those who grieve, Too short for those who rejoice. But for those who love, time is not."
"The less one has to do, the less time one finds to do it in. One yawns, one procrastinates, one can do it when one will, and, therefore, one seldom does it at all; whereas those who have a great deal of business must buckle to it; and then they always find time enough to do it."
Time is nothing absolute; its duration depends on the rate of thought and feeling.
Time is a fluid condition which has no existence except in the momentary avatars of individual people.
"What then is time? If no one asks me, I know what it is. If I wish to explain it to him who asks, I do not know."
"Time is the product of changing realities, beings, existences."
Time is the arbitrary division of eternity.
"Time is a part of eternity, and of the same piece with it."
Each day is a little life; every waking and rising a little birth; every fresh morning a little youth; every going to rest and sleep a little death.
Time is eternity begun.
"Time is not a line, but a series of now-points."
"You can't measure time in days the way you can money in dollars, because each day is different."
An hour of pain is as long as a day of pleasure.
"The value of life lies not in the length of days, but in the use we make of them; a man may live long yet live very little."
"Reality is a staircase going neither up nor down, we don't move; today is today, always is today."

My father gave me these hints on speech making: Be sincere ... be brief ... be seated.

I sort of feel like Cindy Crawford's new husband on their wedding night. I know what's expected of me. I'm just not sure I've got the ability to make it interesting.

A lot of you want me to hurry through the introduction. That's because you're so much older you don't want to waste a minute of your life.
Even more exasperating than the guy who thinks he knows it all is the one who really does.
"We will then hear from the founder of the Mayo Clinic, . . . Dr. Ted Clinic."
The first Rotarian was the first man to call John the Baptist Jack.

"When I was preparing for this speech I asked my family for advice. One member replied, ""There's a first time for everything, so try to be funny and brief."""
"Most experts suggest that one should open with a joke. Obviously, they've never heard me tell a joke."
"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I'm pleased to be with you. (Pause) That concludes my prepared remarks."
I'm moving down here . . . because some of you in the back might not be able to hear my talk . . . and that wouldn't be fair to those who can hear it.
"It has been discovered experimentally that you can draw laughter from an audience anywhere in the world, of any class or race, simply by walking on a stage and uttering the words ""I am a married man."""

"New opinions are always suspected, and usually opposed, without any other reason but because they are not already common."
"So many men, so many opinions."
"Three Spaniards, four opinions."
We are so vain that we even care for the opinion of those we don't care for.
"One should respect public opinion in so far as it is necessary to avoid starvation and to keep out of prison, but anything that goes beyond this is voluntary submission to an unnecessary tyranny."
"Public opinion, a vulgar, impertinent, anonymous tyrant who deliberately makes life unpleasant for anyone who is not content to be the average man."
You've no idea what a poor opinion I have of myself - and how little I deserve it.
Predominant opinions are generally the opinions of the generation that is vanishing.
To be positive: to be mistaken at the top of one's voice.
When I want your opinion I'll give it to you.
The sound of tireless voices is the price we pay for the right to hear the music of our own opinions.
It is always considered a piece of impertinence in England if a man of less than two or three thousand a year has any opinions at all upon important subjects.
"The pressure of public opinion is like the pressure of the atmosphere; you can't see it - but all the same, it is sixteen pounds to the square inch."
The right to be heard does not automatically include the right to be taken seriously.

The foolish and the dead alone never change their opinions.
All empty souls tend to extreme opinion.
Too often we . . . enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought.
Opinions cannot survive if one has no chance to fight for them.
"There are a great many opinions in this world, and a good half of them are professed by people who have never been in trouble."
It were not best that we should all think alike; it is difference of opinion that makes horseraces.
"Stiff in opinion, always in the wrong."
"It is rare that the public sentiment decides immorally or unwisely, and the individual who differs from it ought to distrust and examine well his own opinion."
Those who never retract their opinions love themselves more than they love truth.
"Public opinion, though often formed upon a wrong basis, yet generally has a strong underlying sense of justice."
Opinions cannot survive if one has no chance to fight for them.
The foolish and the dead alone never change their opinion.
Force and not opinion is the queen of the world; but it it opinion that uses the force.

"The feeble tremble before opinion, the foolish defy it, the wise judge it, the skillful direct it."
"I know where there is more wisdom than is found in Napoleon, Voltaire, or all the ministers present and to come - in public opinion."
You create your opportunities by asking for them.
A wise man will make more opportunities than he finds.
Look for opportunity. You can't wait for it to knock on the door. ... You might not be home.
"If you want to succeed in the world, you must make your own opportunities."
Life is a narrative that you have a hand in writing.
"Mediocre men wait for opportunity to come to them. Strong, able, alert men go after opportunity."
A filly who wants to run will always find a rider.
"Life is what we make it; always has been, always will be."

Many things are lost for want of asking.
"You don't just luck into things ... you build step by step, whether it's friendships or opportunities."
Every man is the architect of his own fortune.
He that waits upon fortune is never sure of a dinner.
There is no security on this earth. Only opportunity.
Too many people are thinking of security instead of opportunity; they seem more afraid of life than of death.
"Freedom is nothing else but a chance to be better, whereas enslavement is a certainty of the worst."
The opportunity is often lost by deliberating.
I have always been waiting for something better-sometimes to see the best I had snatched from me.
"The sad truth is that opportunity doesn't knock twice. You can put things off until tomorrow but tomorrow may never come. Where will you be a few years down the line? Will it be everything you dreamed of? We seal our fate with the choices we take, but don't give a second thought to the chances we take."
"You decide you'll wait for your pitch. Then as the ball starts toward the plate, you think about your stance. And then you think about your swing. And then you realize that the ball that went past you for a strike was your pitch."
Small opportunities are often the beginning of great enterprises.
Any ritual is an opportunity for transformation.
Ability is of little account without opportunity.
Our opportunities to do good are our talents.
"Opportunity knocks at every man's door once. On some men's door it hammers till it breaks down the door and then it goes in and wakes him up if he's asleep, and ever afterward it works for him as a night watchman."
It is less important to redistribute wealth than it is to redistribute opportunity.
You can't make souffle rise twice.
"A door that seems to stand open must be a man's size, or it is not the door that Providence means for him."
"Next to knowing when to seize an opportunity, the most important thing in life is to know when to forgo an advantage."
The follies which a man regrets most in his life are those which he didn't commit when he had the opportunity.
To see a shadow and think it is a tree-that is a pity; but to see a tree and to think it a shadow can be fatal.
"Great opportunities come to all, but many do not know they have met them. The only preparation to take advantage of them is simple fidelity to watch what each day brings."
Opportunities are everywhere.
"Opportunities are usually disguised as hard work, so most people don't recognize them."
"The world is all gates, all opportunities, strings of tension waiting to be struck."
No great man ever complains of want of opportunity.
"Great opportunities to help others seldom come, but small ones come daily."
"Men do with opportunities as children do at the seashore; they fill their little hands with sand, and then let the grains fall through, one by one, till all are gone."
"Do not wait for ideal circumstances, nor for the best opportunities; they will never come."
Nothing is so often irretrievably missed as a daily opportunity.
"If a man looks sharply and attentively, he shall see fortune; for though she be blind, yet she is not invisible."
Know thine opportunity.
In great affairs we ought to apply ourselves less to creating chances than to profiting from those that are offered.
Opportunity is as scarce as oxygen; men fairly breathe it and do not know it.
"Opportunities do not come with their values stamped upon them. ... To face every opportunity of life thoughtfully, and ask its meaning bravely and earnestly, is the only way to meet supreme opportunities when they come, whether open-faced or disguised."
"We are told that talent creates its own opportunities. But it sometimes seems that intense desire creates not only its own opportunities, but its own talents."
How many opportunities present themselves to a man without his noticing them?
"Luck affects everything. Let your hook be always cast. In the stream where you least expect it, there will be a fish."
The opportunity that God sends does not wake up him who is asleep.
"Present opportunities are neglected, and attainable good is slighted, by minds busied in extensive ranges and intent upon future advantages."
Opportunities multiply as they are seized; they die when neglected. Life is a long line of opportunities.
It is often hard to distinguish between the hard knocks in life and those of opportunity.
"I think luck is the sense to recognize an opportunity and the ability to take advantage of it. Everyone has bad breaks, but everyone also has opportunities. The man who can smile at his breaks and grab his chances gets on."
"To improve the golden moment of opportunity, and catch the good that is within our reach, is the great art of life."
"The greatest achievement of the human spirit is to live up to one's opportunities, and make the most of one's resources."
"When one door closes, another opens. But we often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door that we do not see the one which has opened for us."
"The opportunities for enjoyment in your life are limitless. If you feel you are not experiencing enough joy, you have only yourself to blame."
Opportunities are often things you haven't noticed the first time around.
The successful man is one who had the chance and took it.
Vigilance in watching opportunity; tact and daring in seizing upon opportunity; force and persistence in crowding opportunity to its utmost possible achievement-these are the martial virtues which must command success.
To avoid an occasion for our virtues is a worse degree of failure than to push forward pluckily and make a fall.
Opportunity knocks but once.
I was seldom able to see an opportunity until it had ceased to be one.
"If Fortune calls, offer him a seat."
"What the student calls a tragedy, the master calls a butterfly."
"Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls, and looks like work."
Times of stress and difficulty are seasons of opportunity when the seeds of progress are sown.
We must look for the opportunity in every difficulty instead of being paralyzed at the thought of the difficulty in every opportunity.
The best impromptu speeches are the ones written well in advance.
"Opportunity can benefit no man who has not fitted himself to seize it and use it. Opportunity woos the worthy, shuns the unworthy. Prepare yourself to grasp opportunity, and opportunity is likely to come your way. It is not so fickle, capricious and unreasoning as some complain."
Opportunity rarely knocks until you are ready. And few people have ever been really ready without receiving opportunity's call.
The secret to success in life is for a man to be ready for his opportunity when it comes.
I always keep myself in a position of being a student.
I think the young actor who really wants to act will find a way ... to keep at it and seize every opportunity that comes along.
"If you want greater prosperity in your life, start forming a vacuum to receive it."
"Unless a man has trained himself for his chance, the chance will only make him ridiculous."
Do not suppose opportunity will knock twice at your door.

One cloud is enough to eclipse all the sun.
The progress of rivers to the ocean is not so rapid as that of man to error.
"When I look in the glass I see that every line in my face means pessimism, but in spite of my face - that is my experience - I remain an optimist."
An optimist is a guy that has never had much experience.
An optimist is a fellow who believes what's going to be will be postponed.
"Pessimist - one who, when he has the choice of two evils, chooses both."
My pessimism goes to the point of suspecting the sincerity of the pessimists.
A pessimist is one who has been compelled to live with an optimist.
Pessimism is only the name that men of weak nerves give to wisdom.
"When it is dark enough, you can see the stars."
There is not enough darkness in all the world to put out the light of even one small candle.
"When things come to the worst, they generally mend."
"The optimist claims we live in the best of all possible worlds, and the pessimist fears this is true."
"Still round the corner there may wait, a new road, or a secret gate."
"When Fortune empties her chamberpot on your head, smile and say 'We are going to have a summer shower.'"
The world gets better every day - then worse again in the evening.
A man he seems of cheerful yesterdays And confident tomorrows.
There is a budding morrow in midnight.
Optimism: A cheerful frame of mind that enables a tea kettle to sing though in hot water up to its nose.
An optimist sees an opportunity in every calamity; a pessimist sees a calamity in every opportunity.
"To look up and not down, To look forward and not back, To look out and not in, and To lend a hand."
"Two men look out through the same bars: One sees the mud, and one the stars."
Keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see the shadow.
Oratory is the power to talk people out of their sober and natural opinions.
Glittering generalities! They are blazing ubiquities.
I am not fond of uttering platitudes In stained-glass attitudes.
"The object of oratory is not truth, but persuasion."
"What the orators want in depth, they give you in length."
It is much safer to obey than to rule.
Let all things be done decently and in order.
"There is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere, anytime."
"When liberty destroys order, the hunger for order will destroy liberty."
Those who are fond of setting things to rights have no great objection to setting them wrong.
To have his path made clear for him is the aspiration of every human being in our beclouded and tempestuous existence.
Our laws make law impossible; our liberties destroy all freedom; our property is organized robbery; our morality an impudent hypocrisy; our wisdom is administered by inexperienced or mal-experienced dupes; our power wielded by cowards and weaklings; and our honour false in all its points. I am an enemy of the existing order for good reasons.
Crude classifications and false generalizations are the curse of organized life.
"Timing, degree and conviction are the three wise men in this life."
"We put things in order - God does the rest. Lay an iron bar east and west, it is not magnetized. Lay it north and south and it is."

Out of intense complexities intense simplicities emerge.

Have a place for everything and have everything in its place.
Set thine house in order.
Order is Heaven's first law.
Originality is the art of concealing your sources.
"Utter originality is, of course, out of the question."
We do not inherit this land from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children.
"Why can't somebody give us a list of things that everybody thinks and nobody says, and another list of things that everybody says and nobody thinks."
"Originality is nothing but judicious imitation. The most original writers borrowed one from another. The instruction we find in books is like fire. We fetch it from our neighbours, kindle it at home, communicate it to others and it becomes the property of all."
"Originality does not consist in saying what no one has ever said before, but in saying exactly what you think yourself."
"What a good thing Adam had - when he said a good thing, he knew nobody had said it before."
All cases are unique and very similar to others.
I invent nothing. I rediscover.
There is nothing new under the sun.
"When people are free to do as they please, they usually imitate each other. Originality is deliberate and forced, and partakes of the nature of a protest."
All profoundly original work looks ugly at first.
Riding hard for glory.
What is originality? Undetected plagiarism.
"The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves."
You always admire what you really don't understand.
What you can't get is just what suits you.
"The dream is real, my friends. The failure to realize it is the only reality."
The true exercise of freedom is-can-nily and wisely and with grace-to move inside what space confines-and not seek to know what lies beyond and cannot be touched or tasted.
Death and taxes and childbirth! There's never any convenient time for any of them!
No one is content with his own lot.
"Let us accept truth, even when it surprises us and alters our views."
To have ideals is not the same as to have impracticable ideals.
There has never been an age that did not applaud the past and lament the present.
"Every stage of life has its troubles, and no man is content with his own age."
"We love in others what we lack ourselves, and would be everything but what we are."
There is less in this than meets the eye.
"When you don't have any money, the problem is food. When you have money, it's sex. When you have both, it's health. If everything is simply jake, then you're frightened of death."
"Diogenes was asked what wine he liked best, and he answered, ""Somebody else's."""
The apples on the other side of the wall are the sweetest.
Nothing is so good as it seems beforehand.
"Happiness is ... usually attributed by adults to children, and by children to adults."
Acorns were good till bread was found.
None of us is ever satisfied with what we are.
"We always long for forbidden things, k and desire what is denied us."
Man's heart is never satisfied; the snake would swallow the elephant.
We all envy other people's luck.

To most of us the real life is the life we do not lead.
Happiness to a dog is what lies on the other side of the door.
Man would be otherwise. That is the essence of the specifically human.
He who would be happy should stay at home.
He who leaves his house in search of happiness pursues a shadow.
It is not irritating to be where one is. It is only irritating to think one would like to be somewhere else.
"Pioneers may be picturesque figures, but they are often rather lonely ones."
He that is discontented in one place will seldom be happy in another.
We are under the spell always of what is distant from us. It is not in our nature to desire passionately what is near at hand.
"In all climates, under all skies, man's happiness is always somewhere else."
In Rome you long for the country. In the country you praise to the skies the distant town.
He who would be happy should stay at home.
"Life is a hospital in which every patient is possessed by the desire of changing his bed. One would prefer to suffer near the fire, and another is certain he would get well if he were by the window."
It is common to overlook what is near by keeping the eye fixed on something remote.
"There are three wants which can never be satisfied: that of the rich, who want something more; that of the sick, who want something different; and that of the traveler, who says, ""Anywhere but here."""
"Happiness grows at our firesides, and is not to be picked in strangers' gardens."
"Men run away to other countries because they are not good in their own, and run back to their own because they pass for nothing in the new places."
The proper means of increasing the love we bear our native country is to reside some time in a foreign one.
"If solid happiness we prize, within our breast this jewel lies, And they are fools who roam; the world has nothing to bestow, From our own selves our bliss must flow, And that dear hut-our home."
A child on a farm sees a plane fly overhead and dreams of a faraway place. A traveler on the plane sees the farmhouse and dreams of home.
"Life has no smooth road for any of us; and in the bracing atmosphere of a high aim the very roughness stimulates the climber to steadier steps till the legend, ""over steep ways to the stars,"" fulfills itself."
The only normal people are the ones you don't know very well.
"Before we set our hearts too much upon anything, let us examine how happy they are who already possess it."
What makes us discontented with our condition is the absurdly exaggerated idea we have of the happiness of others.
Nobody's problem is ideal. Nobody has things just as he would like them.
Everybody in the world ought to be sorry for everybody else. We all have our little private hell.
"We are convinced that happiness is never to be found, and each believes it possessed by others, to keep alive the hope of obtaining it for himself."
Men would be angels; angels would be gods.
None think the great unhappy but the great.
"If every man's internal care Were written on his brow, How many would our pity share Who raise our envy now?"
Misfortunes come to all men.
You have no idea how big the other fellow's troubles are.
"I have been very happy, very rich, very beautiful, much adulated, very famous and very unhappy."
"I feel successful when the writing goes well. This lasts five minutes. Once, when I was on the bestseller list, I also felt successful. That lasted three minutes."
Great and small suffer the same mishaps.
I thought I had reached a point in life where everything would be smooth. But it is not. It just gets more jagged and pitted and filled with turns that take you into the dark recesses of your mind. It never seems to get easy.
"If I were given a change of life, I'd like to see how it would be to live as a mere six-footer."
I just want to be an ordinary girl.
"Money is another pressure. I'm not complaining, I'm just saying that there's a certain luxury in having no money. I spent ten years in New York not having it, not worrying about it. Suddenly you have it, then you worry, where is it going? Am I doing the right thing with it?"
"On the outside one is a star. But in reality, one is completely alone, doubting everything. To experience this loneliness of soul is the hardest thing in the world."
"There is no man in this world without some manner of tribulation or anguish, though he be king or pope."
The only incurable troubles of the rich are the troubles that money can't cure.
There is no man in any rank who is always at liberty to act as he would incline; in some quarter or other he is limited by circumstances.
None of us can be free of conflict and woe. Even the greatest men have had to accept disappointments as their daily bread. ... The art of living lies less in eliminating our troubles than in growing with them.
Renown is a source of toil and sorrow; obscurity is a source of happiness.
My crown is called content; a crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.
"If I had my life to live over, I wish I could be a great pianist or something."
There is no armour against fate; death lays his icy hands on kings.
Pale death with impartial tread beats at the poor man's cottage door and at the palaces of kings.
"I want to be able to live without a crowded calendar. I want to be able to read a book without feeling guilty, or go to a concert when I like."
I'd like to be a truck driver. I think you could run your life that way. It wouldn't be such a bad way of doing it. It would offer a chance to be alone.
There is as much confusion in the world of the gods as in ours.
Pray the gods do not envy your happiness!
The suffering of the rich is among the sweetest pleasures of the poor.
"Oh God, don't envy me, I have my own pains."
Success is counted sweetest by those who never succeed.
"I have known no man of genius who had not to pay, in some affliction or defect either physical or spiritual, for what the gods had given him."
"I have been very happy, very rich, very beautiful, much adulated, very famous and very unhappy."
"I feel successful when the writing goes well. This lasts five minutes. Once, when I was on the bestseller list, I also felt successful. That lasted three minutes."
Men are all the same. They always think that something they are going to get is better than what they have got.
Not all speed is movement.
"Success is not greedy, as people think, but insignificant. That's why it satisfies nobody."
"Oh, I wish that God had not given me what I prayed for! It was not so good as I thought."
"Beggars do not envy millionaires, though of course they will envy other beggars who are more successful."
"Ambition, having reached the summit, longs to descend."
What we call progress is the exchange of one nuisance for another nuisance.
"The superpowers often behave like two heavily armed blind men feeling their way around a room, each believing himself in mortal peril from the other, who he assumes to have perfect vision."
"Wanting to change, to improve, a person's situation means offering him, for difficulties in which he is practiced and experienced, other difficulties that will find him perhaps even more bewildered."
Being considered beautiful at a young age sends confusing signals. You think people only like you because of your beauty.
Youth is not a question of years: one is young or old from birth.
"When I was fourteen, I was the oldest I ever was. ... I've been getting younger ever since."
"A child's world is fresh and new and beautiful, full of wonder and excitement. It is our misfortune that for most of us that clear-eyed vision, that true instinct for what is beautiful and awe-inspiring, is dimmed and even lost before we reach adulthood."
"Sure, I'm for helping the elderly. I'm going to be old myself someday."
Youth is something very new: twenty years ago no one mentioned it.
"A comfortable old age is the reward of a well-spent youth. Instead of its bringing sad and melancholy prospects of decay, it would give us hopes of eternal youth in a better world."
"We turn not older with years, but newer every day."
Old age is when the liver spots show through your gloves.
"The middle years, caught between children and parents, free of neither: the past stretches back too densely, it is too thickly populated, the future has not yet thinned out."
"It is not how old you are, but how you are old."
One of the many things nobody ever tells you about middle age is that it's such a nice change from being young.
"When you become 100, life changes completely."
"This is a youth-oriented society, and the joke is on them because youth is a disease from which we all recover."
"Old age, believe me, is a good and pleasant thing. It is true you are gently shouldered off the stage, but then you are given such a comfortable front stall as spectator."
I look forward to growing old and wise and audacious.
"It is so comical to hear oneself called old, even at ninety I suppose!"
I enjoy my wrinkles and regard them as badges of distinction-I've worked hard for them!
"Time-our youth-it never really goes, does it? It is all held in our minds."
Even I don't wake up looking like Cindy Crawford.
"We all lose our looks eventually, better develop your character and interest in life."
The lovely thing about being forty is that you can appreciate twenty-five-year-old men more.
The only thing that makes one place more attractive to me than another is the quantity of heart I find in it.
"A woman may develop wrinkles and cellulite, lose her waistline, her bust-line, her ability to bear a child, even her sense of humor, but none of that implies a loss of her sexuality, her femininity."
Old age is like a plane flying through a storm. Once you are aboard there is nothing you can do.
In youth the days are short and the years are long. In old age the years are short and day's long.
How long can you be cute?
Being pretty on the inside means you don't hit your brother and you eat all your peas-that's what my grandma taught me.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
"When you're fifty, you start thinking about things you haven't thought about before. I used to think getting old was about vanity-but actually it's about losing people you love. Getting wrinkles is trivial."
I am desperate and vulnerable. ... I am always terrified.... Beauty can sometimes be so very troublesome.
I hate myself on the screen. I want to die ... my voice is either too high or too gravelly. I want to dive under the carpet.... I'd love to be tall and willowy ... I'm short.
"After a certain number of years, our faces become our biographies."
"I don't like my voice. I don't like the way I look. I don't like the way I move. I don't like the way I act. I mean, period. So, you know, I don't like myself."
Not always the fanciest cake that's there Is the best to eat!
"No, Doctor, I don't want to grow young again. I just want to keep on growing old."
"It is quite wrong to think of old age as a downward slope. On the contrary, one climbs higher and higher with the advancing years, and that, too, with surprising strides."
"I look forward to being older, when what you look like becomes less and less an issue and what you are is the i point."
"When you've got the personality, you don't need the nudity."
"The only real elegance is in the mind; if you've got that, the rest really comes from it."
"Beauty can get a woman what she wants: love and money. But when beauty leaves you, so can the things it brought."
"If you're considered a beauty, it's hard to be accepted doing anything but standing around."

"There are two big forces at work, external and internal. We have very little control over external forces such as tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, disasters, illness, and pain. What really matters is the internal force. How do I respond to those disasters? Over that I have complete control."

Exhilaration of life can be found only with an upward look. This is an exciting world. It is cram-packed with opportunity. Great moments wait around every corner.

Nothing splendid has ever been achieved except by those who dared to believe that something inside of them was superior to circumstance.
"It is the ultimate wisdom of the mountains that we are never so much human as when we are striving for what is beyond our grasp, and that there is no battle worth the winning save that against our own ignorance and fear."
"I keep the telephone of my mind open to peace, harmony, health, love, and abundance. Then whenever doubt, anxiety, or fear try to call me, they keep getting a busy signal and soon they'll forget my number."
"You can do anything you wish to do, have anything you wish to have, be anything you wish to be."

"No matter what level of your ability, you have more potential than you can ever develop in a lifetime."
"Everyone has got it in him, if he will only make up his mind and stick at it. None of us is born with a stop-valve on his powers or with a set limit to his capacities. There is no limit possible to the expansion of each one of us."
Everyone has inside of him a piece of good news. The good news is that you don't know how great you can bel How much you can love! What you can accomplish! And what your potential is I
"The power which resides in man is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he until he has tried."
"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened."
Trust yourself. You know more than you think you do.
"If we did all the things we are capable of doing, we would literally astound ourselves."
"Each of us makes his own weather, determines the color of the skies in the emotional universe which he inhabits."

"Be brave enough to live creatively. The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition.
